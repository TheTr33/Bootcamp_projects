Skills to transition from data scientist to ML engineer,"Someone recently asked me in a comment what skills I would recommend for Data Scientists looking to transition to ML Engineering, so wrote down a quick list and thought it might deserve its own post.

It looks like a lot but bear in mind that I learned all of these “on the job” to solve specific problems (i.e. I didn’t do any of these as “independent study” before getting my first ML Engineering role). So in terms of ""skills needed to transition"", I would actually say all you need is a ""hacker mindset"" and the ability to learn quickly/independently.

My list:

* HTML/CSS/JavaScript/React
   * Data labeling apps
   * Prototypes/mockups
   * Integrating models into existing webapps
* Java/C#/Ruby
   * Integrating models into existing backend services
* C/C++
   * Customizing &amp; Extending open-source ML libraries=
* Docker/Kubernetes/AWS
   * Deploying models
* Jenkins/Buildkite
   * Automating model build/deployment pipelines
* Kafka/SQS/Datadog/ELK/Bugsnag
   * Building &amp; Debugging distributed applications
* Technical writing/UML
   * Documenting technical decisions, getting alignment/buyin from other (non-ML) engineers

"I need a MS for the qualification, not necessarily the knowledge. Any mediocre, online programs you recommend?","NOT REALLY! I absolutely want to learn as much as possible but I just don't think I can get into a great program. Also, I have done well learning on my own and moving ahead in my career. That said, I feel that my B.S. in physics will hold me back soon enough. My company has begun hiring MS and PhDs recently (for other depts. but it won't be long)  and I think I better make sure I get the qualifications even if I think I can learn it on my own.

So, I'm looking for online programs that would teach me, but mostly do as the qualification, along the lines of applied stats/applied machine learning.

Good Background: I was an analyst at a fin-tech firm and then moved into building data infrastructure at an ad-tech firm. It's almost fully a SWE role except it takes a little stats to understand the projects that are being put into production. We're probably a couple years away from putting some good ML into production and I'd like to be a solid part of that journey (plenty or work to do in the meantime). I did some computational physics but at an undergrad level. Most math doesn't scare me and I'm willing to do pre-reqs. Almost anytime I've been asked to do something I've said, 'yep, I can do that', and then managed to learn well enough to do it ok. It's not the best or how everyone would do it but it's served me well.

Bad Background: I was a below average student at a no-name state school. I'm capable but don't have a good academic record whatsoever. Repeated several math courses. All due to lack of direction and apathy at the time.

If anyone has been in a similar position (poor record but good discipline and ability) and managed to level up to an MS has advice, I'd be a happy to listen! Thanks.",datascience,1577157694,alex-the-alright,7,1,True,2019-12-23

Research Experience for Top Grad Schools,"Hello all, I’m currently at a good school in New York for my undergrad, and I’m thinking about applying to NYU or Columbia’s Data Science graduate programs next year or so.

I came in as a physics major, but quickly realized data science and math/compsci/statistics were better for me, and have even gotten a DS internship in the city for the summer, but I still have the research project I picked up my freshman year. It’s a project in computational astrophysics that will probably culminate in a small publication I might be first author on, and after that my professor has expressed some ideas about other projects too... but I’m starting to feel pressure to leave the professor I’m working with and look into more “data sciencey” projects. 

At the same time, the physics professor I’m working with is a real titan in his field with lots of notoriety, and my project itself actually deals heavily in data science (moreso than it does in actual physics probably) as I am analyzing data from a black hole with various Python toolkits, and I am generally happy with it.

Should I begin to try to diversify my research experience, or do you guys think there will be opportunities for me to convey the connection between my physics research and data science in my grad school application? I know lots of data science in academia actually manifests as the means to carrying out heavily computational projects in a number of fields, but there are professors in our Data Science institute doing more “pure” DS research.

I’ve also recently been thinking about spending some time working after undergrad to gain experience and explore my interests, and then apply a year or two later if I’m still interested.  Is this a realistic path for a lot of people in DS?

Are there any other tips you guys would recommend for someone in my situation? If you have any more questions about my situation PM me or drop em in the comments!",datascience,1577171654,n2theohan,1,1,True,2019-12-24
How to measure this?,"We’ve got an internet library, where people can buy or rent paper books from other people. 
The process looks like this: Jane has unused books, she creates a library stash which consists of book records for each book (if she wants to specify). Then the Bob searches the lib for a specific book, connects with Jane (through the social media, not our app) about this specific book that she has, and they may make a deal between themselves. 

How can we measure that the book-crossing actually happened with these pair of people if we don’t track transactions between people? We already have some sort of switch-signal, if both people become inactive on certain book after connecting (the less active they are the more proba), but this is somewhat vague.

Worthwhile to learn Julia?,"I am on winter break and I want to devote my free time to learning something new, particularly in the area of data science.  I am proficient in Python/R and I will be using these languages mostly when I start my job in August as a Data Scientist. I've been doing research and doing some self-reflection if I should take the leap to begin learning and incorporating Julia as a part of my tool kit.  

I don't consider myself the type of programmer that feels I need to learn multiple types of languages just to learn them. I have read some compelling takes that makes me feel I should take learning Julia seriously, especially if I want to further my career as a Data Scientists. 

Another component I was considering spending time on was Django. I find myself creating useful pipelines in Python on my own computer, but always come short of my greater vision because of the lack of expertise in web application development.

Take Home Challenge Interpretation of Question,"Hi,

I am currently applying for a Data Science position and have to finish a take-home challenge for one of the companies. However, I don't really understand what they want me to do and hope a more experienced Redditor can help me interpret the question. Unfortunately, I can't reach anyone at the company due to Christmas holidays

I have a data set with transactions of customers and another dataset with information about age, country... of those customers. Now I am asked to define a target metric for engagement and say how I would define unengaged vs. engaged customer. Afterwards, I have to use this logic to build a model to classify engaged vs unengaged customers (they point out overfitting due to feature used in the target metric). 

How would you interpret these questions? 

Do I first have to say *if target\_metric &gt; x: engaged* and then build a supervised model to classify the users again? 

OR 

Would you define several metrics that could separate engaged and unengaged customers and then use an unsupervised model to find two clusters that would then be engaged vs unengaged?

Master's degree or sticking with undergrad,"This question has been asked and answered a few times but there are some things that make my situation different than many of the other posters.

First, some background info. I'm currently finishing my undergrad in Statistics at a non top-tier Canadian university. I have ~1 year of internship experience in DS roles. I was recently fortunate enough to do well in an internship and have received a full time offer from a company as a DS. The offer is very good at ~120k TC. Alternatively, I have a pretty good relationship with a couple professors that have been asking me if I would like to do a master's degree with them in Statistics. Both would have an emphasis in some data science related topic. This would allow me to pursue more technically challenging work, though frankly I'm most interested in working on neat problems rather than neat tech.

My concern is that while this is a pretty great offer I might be limiting myself for future roles. From past experience most places are looking for applicants with master's degree or higher. Worse yet, there aren't that many companies in Canada that will pay me more as I progress through my career.

Fell in love with stats and ""data science"" due to my current job. I am a data analyst at a large retail company and I have had the opportunity to work with huge sets of data (SQL skills are very high), data visualizations in Tableau and PowerBI, and in R I have had the opportunity to create k-means clustering scripts, neural networks for classifications, forecasting sales using prophet, linear/logistic regression, survival analysis, etc. etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to have a great stat foundation because my goal is to become a data scientist or a senior data analyst at a large tech company and most of those posting mention I need to have an undergrad in stats or mathematics. Since, at the moment going back and getting a second undergrad isn't quite an option can someone guide me in some online courses that covers elementary stats to the higher level courses.

Can I get into a decent Masters in Data Science Program (USA) with a low undergraduate GPA in Industrial Engineering.,"Hi, 

&amp;#x200B;

I am a graduating Industrial Engineering student with a minor in IT from the Philippines. Over the past year, I've developed an interest for data science, and would like to pursue a graduate degree abroad (preferably USA). Unfortunately, I  will probably graduate with a 2.8 after this last trimester (see attached image).

 Just for some context, I started out my undergraduate degree , with a GPA of around 2.99 at the end of freshman year, landing in the dean's list 2/3 of the trimesters.    

Towards the end of my sophomore year, I began to experience personal issues which eventually took a toll on my grades and my motivation. At this point, I just wanted to get college over , so I began to work on a side business and alternative sources of income thinking it would grant me greater independence in case I needed it. By the end of my Junior Year, my CGPA fell to 2.6 and I realized I wanted to get back on my feet, academically

Aside from improving my grades, I decided to pursue some extra-curricular activities, such as case competitions sponsored by established fortune 500 companies. As a result, I had won several awards, and secured two internships related to business intelligence. One of these internships, was mandatory for my undergraduate degree, while the second, I took on voluntarily and juggled it with a 18 credit/unit load.  I also decided to pursue a challenging thesis topic in operations research, hoping to augment my portfolio, which I am now about to finish and hopefully publish. 

I am now on my last term, with a CGPA of 2.8. I understand this is just average, or maybe even on the lower end in terms of US standards, but from my own observation, I estimate that it will be on the upper 20-25% of my graduating batch.  I plan to start reviewing for the GRE soon, as well as improve my skills in programming and ML through online courses/books and build my portfolio. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was hoping for some insights and tips regarding my current situation, as well as suggestions for applicable MS in Data Science programs.

I need a harsh reality check on whether I can still make it in Data Science (I have a PhD in Physics),"Apologies beforehand as this is going to be long. 

Before you instinctively say “yes”, let me just quickly clarify that my PhD in Physics was entirely experimental, and I did not do any kind of advanced numerical simulations that people kind of expect of us to do. My only exposure to coding was literally just writing hacked up python scripts with zero thought given about OOP, documenting and unit testing.

Now that I’ve got that out of the way, here’s the summary of what I’ve tried so far:

- Been applying for 1 year 
- Applied to about 200 places in total (some of them were low effort I admit)
- Did a Data Science bootcamp 7 months ago
- Several recruiters started calling me on LinkedIn
- Had about 20 interview onsite interviews after the bootcamp 
- Managed to progress to the final stages for 10 of them 
- Rejected from all of them
- Recruiters have stopped approaching me for the past 3 months

In interviews I got asked about almost everything imaginable from machine learning algorithms to REST APIs to Hadoop/Spark and even A/B testing.

I admit I was completely unprepared at first and had no idea just how much I had to prepare just to pass these interviews, even though the job itself may be just BI reporting or excel stuff in disguise.

However, I am wondering whether this realization has come too late now. I mean, as I said earlier, recruiters have stopped approaching me on LinkedIn for the past 3 months. 

Also, I only just recently found a part time temp job and it’s only a few hours a week. But I could get axed at any time.

Just so I don’t keep deluding myself reading my pile of books on Machine Learning, Spark, Flask etc, I need to have a harsh reality check on what my chances are now in Data Science, if there is any.

Taking into account :

- I’m not exactly a fresh PhD grad anymore (it’s been 1 year now)
- I don’t have any relevant commercial experience unless you count the bootcamp
- The current immense competition for junior data scientists

Because there isn't a programming backend that I can easily access in Tableau, it appears that the best way to learn it is to have a use case for it, and then learn as I go.

Is this a terrible approach? I'm just not sure how much more I could gain from watching more videos beyond the half-hour ""Getting Started"" video on the Tableau website.",datascience,1577474170,OmNomNomData,5,1,True,2019-12-27

Education/Career advice,"Hi all, so I currently have one more year of my undergrad majoring in math/comp sci. My GPA is really low currently 2.7. I have mostly A's in my math courses and mostly C's in Comp Sci (I've had a lot of personal stuff going on in college which effected my ability to do work, and I can learn maths fairly quickly). I'm hoping to boost my GPA up to close to a 3 in my final year. 

I would like to do the online Georgia Tech MS in ML, and think I have a decent shot getting in since although my GPA sucks I've been taking some GRE practice tests and have been getting in the range of 168-170 in quant section.

My question is if I do have a high GPA from my masters will I have a shot at getting into a PhD program for DS/ML? (I'd also be limiting my options to New York area).

Is any of this realistic? I'd like to work as an actual Data Scientist, not a data analyst, or programmer.  Please be brutally honest with me.

Also, as an aside (this might deserve its own post) but how important is it that I get a PhD from a university to get a real DS job at a company?",datascience,1577477761,neslef,9,1,True,2019-12-27
How to get team members up to speed?,"We are a multidisciplinary group of data scientists and analysts and myself and another person are recent hires. I come from a python background and the other person comes from an R background. Our code base is in R. 

With the other hire, we've noticed that she has been constantly talking about her expertise in R and analytics, but she has been having difficulty in very basic things so we are confused in what was she programmed and in what way. She will look at my code and tell me it could be better, but offer no real feedback. The senior data scientist has hinted perhaps she will be guided towards data visualization. She has a very hard time concentrating and staying still and has mentioned she has a learning disorder and PTSD so we felt perhaps we need to approach things differently with her. 

I, myself am a little worried as once it becomes busier, there may be less assistance we can give her. Plus, it is a little frustrating to get emails about basic setup. I want to be a good teammate. But, I found myself just having to ignore some of the repetitive questions. 

***What do you recommend in this case?*** We have been holding R practice sessions where we can all work on projects as a team, which I think has been incredibly helpful. We do our best to not irritate her insecurity, but it looks like this will happen regardless, as I think she feels like she got in a bit over her head.

Second Master’s for DS?,"I’m currently in the Army with an accounting undergrad working in Finance. I am currently working through a master’s in analytics via GT online platform. 

I tried applying for a branch change to the Army’s version of DS/Operations Research, but wasn’t accepted this year. I’m just too early in my timeline and I’ll have a very good shot next year.

My initial “ideal” plan was to actually complete my masters on campus if I was accepted into both the branch and GT. Given the next window of application for both the branch and school, I’ll be practically done with my current master’s.

The good news is the Army will still fund another Master’s (or PhD further down the road) as I’m paying for this one using a separate, smaller benefit.

"The red pill on ""Data Science"" and ""AI"" people need to take in","As a finance major who started his journey in this field of study completely through self-learning, here are some of the hard truths one needs to hear if they ever plan to jump into the so called hype train of ""AI"" and ""Data Science""

&amp;#x200B;

* **Data science is not just about predictions**: I see so many freshers approach me and ask me ""So I want to predict X using some Y and Z. Is that not data science?"". NO it is not data science. Data science is a multidisciplinary field which focuses on deriving maximum value from information through statistical and programming methods. It is not just predicting the outcome of some input, but it is also the art and science of understanding, dissecting and making inferences on data that can bring in fruitful value for others. Whoever markets data science to you as a ""way of predicting something"", please take their words with caution.
* **It cannot be learnt through Coursera, Udemy or any online courses**: This one is perhaps the most occurring pattern I see amongst newbies who plan to master machine learning and AI through online certifications. Let me tell you something, if these certs and courses were to make you a data scientist, every university or institution in this world which teaches students the concepts of probability theory, linear algebra, calculus from ground up has to be stupid. Machine learning and AI are extremely deep fields with a lot of intricacies in them that just can't be understood properly through online courses. Sure, the courses give us a brief primer but if you plan to apply ML or AI in any real world scenario without understanding the underlying mechanics of them, please don't. Drill the mathematics along, grind in them and understand why things are the way they are. There are millions of people working on the advancement of this field in the industry and academia, so it will be an insult to their years of hardwork and perseverance if one claimed that they understand ML or AI after going through some online courses. 
* **Stay away from the hype as much as you can**: The ever growing rush to jump into jobs of data science and machine learning because it is the hot trend floating around the market is the most gruesome form of tragedy I have taken place. The hype is created by folks who don't know jackshit about ML, AI or even statistics, atleast how I see it. In my internship, my sales manager was dumb enough to ask me to detect fraud stock transactions just by listening to the voice of the trader/broker. Like hold up, did you just ask me to singlehandedly develop a system which requires a whole department of PhD's, domain experts, ML engineers and DS's? 
* **Specialize in something**: As mentioned above, this field is immensely vast and attempting to be a godfather in machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, meta learning and whatnot, that's an overkill. Pick an area of domain which you are interested in and start exploring how statistics and machine learning is applied in it. Its better to be good at one thing and have expertise than to be that dude who claims to be good at making GAN's, fraud detection models, big data management and having supreme mastery on 5 languages. 
* **The learning shall never end**: Maybe this might sound repelling for a few here, but this is the real red pill of data science, ML and AI; the learning shall never end. There will be days where you will develop some of the most exciting and amazing models for deriving insights, but there will also be days when you will have to sit back, read the math and constantly be updated with all the progress that is happening in this field. There will be days when you will be writing amazing code that puts the whole team in awe, but there will be days where something you saw on Stackoverflow will make you wonder ""I suck at this"". Revision is the key here in this field. Don't stop learning, revise something if you have to, and keep working forward with the goal of learning. Trust me, I started out as a complete noob and after 3 years I still am a noob, just a more educated one. 
* **Stay humble**: Lastly, if you ever feel like you know a lot, just go to Kaggle notebooks, stackexchange or read some of the papers on Google Scholar or ArXiv. Simple as that.

Maybe what all I said might not apply for everyone here but at the end, the reality is simple; Good things take time to learn and years to master.",datascience,1577636075,clutchking_asiimov,8,1,True,2019-12-29

Data science bootcamps/self-learning,"First off, let me apologize for the content of this post, because I know it's something people often hate to talk about.
I am looking at data science bootcamps and online, self-teaching materials because I have a very strong interest in public health and environmental applications using data science algorithms. My background, for reference, is in the humanities and social sciences - although I do have an advanced degree (an M.A.). So, it would be quite a switch from what I am used to doing, but ultimately one I feel really strongly about. I have used free online resources to familiarize myself with basic principles, and feel that I want to delve in more fully.
As someone with a social sciences background (even though it's an M.A. from a highly respected university), I don't feel like I will be taken seriously if I self-teach. I honestly feel like I need some name or program that has vouched for me and this major shift in my educational and career goals.

So, my questions are: is this assumption correct? What bootcamps or programs might you recommend for someone like me?

As a disclaimer, I know jobs in the field can be hard without an advanced degree in the field. However, I am flexible in how I use data science in my career, and most likely would enjoy working in the public policy/NGO field in some way, using my knowledge of data science to leverage my more qualitative background.",datascience,1577652818,validesophie,1,1,True,2019-12-29
Opensource PHP software for Presenting Data,"Is there any good free PHP software for presenting graphs on a website from data from a MySQL database?

Finding Grafana is incredibly good for quickly showing data from a MySQL database. However It seems to be focussed on dashboard style / monitoring usage for logged in users. 

Is there an alternative that’s similar in style of the graphs it outputs which enables you to present the  graph data as a public website without the dashboard style interface? Preferably php and opensource. The closest I’ve found to achieving this kind of thing with graphs for a public website is chart.js but looks like a lot more effort to get graphs than Grafana where you just input SQL queries and it does all the hard work for you.

The data to be visualised is nothing to do with system monitoring and would be from publicly available transport data that is presented to a wide audience as a graph for much easier comprehension than a table, perhaps with some bespoke branding.

Like the style of graphs that Grafana produces, the api and the ability to produce images which can be automatically fed to Twitter but haven’t found anything comparable for generic data visualisation.

Paths in Data Science - ML vs. Insights," 

Hi r/datascience,

I’m a grad student in data science at a major university. I’ve recently been questioning what is the right path for me in the field of data science.

I originally became interested in data science because I was fascinated with the ability to leverage data to surface insights and uncover truths that could drive real-world decision-making and impact. I find much of ML, on the other hand, to be tweaking models and fiddling with things to get those couple of points more of accuracy. It doesn’t feel much like uncovering truth and communicating insights at all. It feels similar to tuning up a car.  

I was wondering what paths are available for more insights-driven data science. It seems that ML is all the rage and all the jobs/internships out there are for that. I’m not sure how to tailor my education or look for roles outside of this realm.",datascience,1577656700,i_am_baldilocks,23,1,True,2019-12-29

Bioinformatics to data science,"Hey every one,

I've started a bioinformatics masters degree (I have a bachelor's in biochemistry) while working as a project coordinator and research associate and am finding that I like the data analytics electives more and think there is more opportunity there than in a bioinformatics lab. I'm learning python, R, git and SQL in the classes which seem to be some of the core skills of a data science portfolio.

I'm almost halfway through the masters but think rather than going to bioinformatics. Has anyone else been able to jump from bioinformatics to data science and analytics? I'm planning on taking some more data science electives to declare a data analytics certificate with the masters and then maybe doing a bootcamp to boost up my portfolio and network.

Hey Data Science Professionals!! - What challenges (if at all) are you having with your fitness goals ?,"Hey Everyone! I have recently made a big leap of faith and started my own coaching/consultation business to help Busy Professionals with their fitness needs which I'm very passionate about.

I know that having a job and a busy schedule can seem incongruent with a healthy lifestyle but I'm here to convince people it is not so.

I have identified couple problems that are shared across IT Professionals in general and those are namely:

* Lacking in accurate knowledge regarding nutrition/effective training (Or worse, misinformed in this area.)
* Lack of Consistency/Motivation around fitness and healthy eating habits
* Feeling tired and unmotivated after a long day of work
* Lack of Time in general, other priorities get in the way

I've been wanting to actively pursue Machine Learning and Data Science for more than a year now but haven't been consistent and usually forget after 3-4 days. 

The challenge includes posting what you do on your social media handles so that you stay more committed to this challenge. After a few days, the habit sticks and you simply can't go to sleep without learning something. I've had a few very busy and tiring days too in these 27 days, but I've made sure I did something at least in those days. I'd strongly recommend anyone who's passionate about Machine Learning to take up this challenge. 

I post my challenge details in the blog below, on Github, on Twitter, and my projects on Linkedin.
https://hitheshai.blogspot.com

Here's a summary of how much I was able to learn because of this challenge in 25 Days. Also, getting best wishes from Josh Starmer on one of my Twitter posts (a scholar who runs Statquest channel on YouTube, one of the best in the genre) was a great deal of encouragement. 

(Note: In my version of this challenge, I don't necessarily have to code everyday because of college and other commitments. Some days, even watching a single YouTube video might be sufficient as long as I make some progress from the previous day.)

Completed two MOOCs on Coursera 
•Machine Learning (Days 1-10) 
•Neural Networks and Deep Learning, Part 1 of Deep Learning Specialization (Days 20-25)

Did 2 mini-projects
•Clustering (Day 4)

ELI5 is a Python package which helps to debug machine learning classifiers and explain their predictions.,"[ELI5](https://eli5.readthedocs.io/en/latest) provides support for the following machine learning frameworks and packages: 

It provides support for the following machine learning frameworks and packages:

* scikit-learn. Currently ELI5 allows to explain weights and predictions of scikit-learn linear classifiers and regressors, print decision trees as text or as SVG, show feature importances and explain predictions of decision trees and tree-based ensembles. ELI5 understands text processing utilities from scikit-learn and can highlight text data accordingly. Pipeline and FeatureUnion are supported. It also allows to debug scikit-learn pipelines which contain HashingVectorizer, by undoing hashing.
* Keras - explain predictions of image classifiers via Grad-CAM visualizations.
* xgboost - show feature importances and explain predictions of XGBClassifier, XGBRegressor and xgboost.Booster.
* LightGBM - show feature importances and explain predictions of LGBMClassifier and LGBMRegressor.
* CatBoost - show feature importances of CatBoostClassifier, CatBoostRegressor and catboost.CatBoost.
* lightning - explain weights and predictions of lightning classifiers and regressors.
* sklearn-crfsuite. ELI5 allows to check weights of sklearn\_crfsuite.CRF models.

ELI5 also implements several algorithms for inspecting black-box models (see [Inspecting Black-Box Estimators](https://eli5.readthedocs.io/en/latest/blackbox/index.html)):

* [TextExplainer](https://eli5.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/black-box-text-classifiers.html) allows to explain predictions of any text classifier using [LIME](https://eli5.readthedocs.io/en/latest/blackbox/lime.html) algorithm (Ribeiro et al., 2016). There are utilities for using LIME with non-text data and arbitrary black-box classifiers as well, but this feature is currently experimental.
* [Permutation importance](https://eli5.readthedocs.io/en/latest/blackbox/permutation_importance.html) method can be used to compute feature importances for black box estimators.

Explanation and formatting are separated; you can get text-based explanation to display in console, HTML version embeddable in an IPython notebook or web dashboards, a pandas.DataFrame object if you want to process results further, or JSON version which allows to implement custom rendering and formatting on a client.

How do you try and improve the quality of the data when you aren’t directly responsible for the gathering of it?,"Hi, 

I’m currently doing inputting and analysis of questionnaire data and don’t really have much influence over the wording of the questions or the possible answers. Because the person collecting the data doesn’t really know anything about statistics / DA they are doing things which are seriously affecting the quality of the data (for example, changing the bins for answers between rounds of surveys) or adding options like ‘all my time’ for answers that are otherwise numerical. On the one hand the question changing reflect the changing understanding of the topic and it’s most likely useful for them to find out more specific info, but it obviously makes amalgamation of the rounds of questionnaires harder / less valid. 

So I’ve tried to explain about not changing answer options, why you can and can’t do with cat/num variables etc etc but it’s hard to impress this without them having a better understanding of statistics. For slightly more complex reasons it’s not possible for me to take over the design / implementation of said questionnaires, so I’m basically just left reacting to what I’m given. 

It definitely doesn’t come from a lack of interest / caring (they recently hand coded a load of questionnaire info for me, when I could’ve run it through a script in seconds...).

"Carpal Tunnel, RSI and other health issue obtacles in a data job","Hello,

I was wondering if any of you have health issues such as carpal tunnel syndrome, RSI or other (probably arthritis comes to mind) in this career.

I've been diagnosed 1 year ago. Quite unfortunate, as I've tried pursuing a more technical career 2 years ago and just shortly before I started having these problems, found my passion for programming &amp; analytics.

I'm currently working in hotel Revenue Management, which is very similar to analytics, although less technical, so a better parallel to my work would probably be Product Management.

I felt like I finally found some meaning to life, something I'm passionate about. And recently even got an offer for a job as a BI Developer, which would move me closer to a more technical job. But I turned it down, because my health problems have been getting worse.

I guess the bottom line is this - how much of a problem might these health problems be? I'm still using a keyboard and mouse in my current job, but my fear is that a more technical job will make me use them a lot more, so making my carpal tunnel  + RSI even worse.

But I might be wrong and maybe a lot of time is spent thinking about models, thinking about coding and so on. And less time clicking the mouse. I don't really have trouble with writing, it's more using the mouse. Currently have an analyst who makes most reports for me, so I don't need to do too much with the mouse. As a BI  Dev, clicking around in Tableau it would definitely be worse.

So, my choices are either:

1) follow my passion and risk getting a job in a technical sector

2) continue what I'm doing and go towards management, which I'm not so passionate about but I may not have another choice, looking 10 years in the future

3) maybe  a middle ground - get a job in the data sector, but choose one specialization which uses the least amount of mouse (and ideally keyboard, but this is just future-proofing - currently I don't have so much problems with writing, as I mentioned). so maybe a PM? (not sure if possible without actual Data Science experience). Or I was thinking Consulting, but that would probably have me do management consulting, not data consulting (again, no Data Science experience, although I've been programming + doing analytics + making strategy, forecasting etc for the past 3 years in my job - just in a less technical/math way than a DS would - I'm a business person, not a statistician)",datascience,1577742799,PanFiluta,33,1,True,2019-12-30

"In big dilemma, need help..","Hi good people of r/datascience,

I've been a long time lurker on this sub and I read most of the threads that make it on the front page.

Here's little about me, I have a degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering and I've worked as a BI developer in one of the Big IT consultancies. I mainly worked on ETL - mappings/loading procedures, Visualization, SQL and some UNIX here and there. I have some experience with Big Data, Python programming + JavaScript as well.

Now I've left the organization and working on my grad school applications.

Here's my dilemma, I originally intended to apply for MS in DS programs in universities but now that I am actually applying I feel ""uneasy"", 

All this time I had a profile of Data/Business Analyst and it was pretty good so far and keeping that in mind I thought I would do good in DS as well.
But now I feel, ""What if I actually suck at DS?"" ""What if I can't do all the complex calculus, linear algebra my course work requires me to do?""

My main motivation for choosing DS was career progression. Since I've already dealt with Analyst stuff I should be progressing to the Scientist stuff. That was my thinking.

It might sound crappy but now I think that what if I legitimize my career as a BI Dev by getting a master's degree in Data/Business Analytics instead of a MS in DS.
So far I've set up data pipelines and made dashboards but as Data Scientist I'll have to make algorithms, do linear algebra/calculus stuff and maybe even do crazy amount of programming that I never did as a BI Dev.

Am I ready? What should I do?

I sure like setting up data and data engineering stuff, I was lately leaning towards AWS as well. I am not sure if I'd like the actual Data Scientist work as well.

Any thoughts would be highly appreciate.",datascience,1577745224,Moulik_de,5,1,True,2019-12-30

MDS with Python’s Scikit learn library,"Hi everyone, I have a very specific, weird question about applying MDS with Python.

When creating a distance matrix of the original high dimensional dataset (let’s call it distanceHD) you can either measure those distances with Euclidean or Manhattan distance.

Then, after performing MDS, let’s say I brought my 70+ columns down to 2 columns to plot it on a 2D graph. Now, I can create a NEW distance matrix. Let’s call it distance2D which measures those distances again, either in Manhattan or Euclidean.

Finally, I can find the difference between the two distance matrices (between distanceHD and distance2D) and this new difference matrix will show me if I preserved the distances in the MDS algorithm. I can then compute the stress using the stress function on that difference matrix and the closer the 0 that number is, the better the projection is.

My question: 
I was originally taught to use Manhattan distance in the distanceHD matrix, and to use the Euclidean distance in the distance2D matrix.  But WHY? Why not use Manhattan on both? Or Euclidean on both? Or Euclidean on distanceHD and Manhattan distance on distance2D?

I guess overall question along with that: when do I use either distance metric on the MDS algorithm?

In Defense of SAS,"So don't get me wrong I hate SAS in general. I have a comp sci degree, have experience coding in many different languages, and get frustrated to no end every time I need to use SAS. I used to work at a job where I used R for 90% of my tasks and now work at a job where I use python for 90% of my tasks. But for all the shit it gets and the fact that it was coded in the 70s? It's still insanely fast and good at certain statistical tasks and medium-large sized data. I was working on a proof of concept to prove to my team python was much better and could replace SAS, and I was struggling. When dealing with small data python was much better, but who cares if you can do your work in 50ms compared to 200ms? When the data got bigger many of the tasks I was trying to replicate with python were so much slower that SAS was actually completing the task faster than python could even read the dataset into memory. I'm actually working on a project I can publish to a public github repo because I couldn't believe it. You would think python would shine with data that's slightly large but fits in memory, but SAS was actually winning this. When we started dealing with big data where python required dataset chunking SAS blew it out of the water performance-wise and obviously time to code-wise, since SAS required no modifications while python required much different code to handle chunks at a time.

  
Maybe there were some optimizations I could make with python to speed it up a bit, and I'm not saying SAS is not going to be obsolete in the next few years, I'm just saying I think a lot of data scientists hate on SAS without understanding the amount of genius that went into it. We're talking about software built in the 70s when large amounts of memory weren't a thing, and it still is out-performing state of the art data science programming software in 2019 for some use cases. I yearn for the day that's not the case and when real programming languages can replicate everything SAS can do, but the fact of the matter is the average r/datascience user scoffs at SAS while there are SAS users making way more money and performing data science tasks much faster and better than them. I much enjoy programming in R or python to SAS, but there are definitely things that SAS does much quicker than either language, which is amazing given the restrictions where it needs to store everything on the disk. Sure if you're an expert python coder you can probably optimize your work better than SAS, but if you're that skilled, you're probably a developer rather than a data scientist. SAS has incredibly fast operations given the flexibility it has and given the restraints of needing to work from the disk rather than memory, and if you're trying to maximize your value as a data scientist you're going to be focusing on things other than coding. If you're looking to be promoted as a data scientist today at a company that has SAS, R, and python, I think you're much more likely to be promoted by spending your time learning more AI/ML algorithms and implementing them in SAS than you are in spending that time optimizing an algorithm or process in R or python. Do you think your boss will be more impressed that you improved the model you own by lowering the adjusted R-squared and now your business can be more confident in its decision-making or will your boss be more impressed that you implemented the same model that's been running for a decade in an open-source programming language?

What are my options?,"Hi everyone, I am currently a business analyst at a large corporation and was considering moving in the direction of data. Throughout my career I have used a lot of SQL to pull data from our databases and VBA to automate reports. I had no formal education in programming though it has become a hobby of mine. I have learned on my own through the years through classes such as CS50 and Udemy courses to further my knowledge. I am no expert by any means but I understand programming concepts well and I have done small pet projects in my free time such as developing an android app.

The parts of my job that I enjoy the most are the SQL and VBA activities. I love putting together a VBA script that will automate something that would otherwise have taken a long time. I find the satisfaction of writing the script and seeing it work way more rewarding than anything else I have done in my career so far. It feels like I have built something that I know will be useful to someone else.

Recently I enrolled in Jose Portilla's udemy course on Data Science with Python. I am halfway through the course and feel that I am developing a very good understanding of the material. After enrolling in the course I began browsing this subreddit and it is rather discouraging. Recently I saw someone mention having a PHD and looking for an internship in data science. To me that screams enormous barrier of entry.. needing a PHD just for an internship? There is no way I can go back to school at the moment to get a PHD and I cannot afford too much of a pay cut as I am the sole provider for my family. It is disappointing because I was very much enjoying the content of Jose's class and was absorbing it rather naturally.

As of now I will continue the class to the end in the case that I learn something that I can use for a future analysis that no one else in my organization would know how to do. To them Python is magic.

Based on my post, does anyone have any advice for career pivots I can look into? As mentioned above I really enjoy writing scripts, automation, I enjoyed the Data Science that I was learning but the barrier of entry seems too high for where I am. I was thinking maybe I can continue learning Python and use it to become a BI Analyst or Test Automation engineer. I enjoy programming (though am not an expert) and writing scripts more than anything I have done in my career thus far. With that being said does anyone have any career advice?

Seeking Advice to Transition Into Data Science (University Junior),"Happy New Year's Eve Everyone,

I am a junior chemical engineering student in university with minors in math and computer science that is increasingly passionate about data science.  I am thinking a career as a data scientist would be very fulfilling; however, I am not sure what a great way to transition in this field would be.  I do have some experience to suggest that this career might be for me.  Let me offer some background.

I have been working for about a year in chemical industry.   My big project was using machine learning to predict a specific chemical reactor anomaly on time-series data.  In no particular order, this involved learning concepts such as:

&amp;#x200B;

* Visualizing the data or using multivariate metrics (i.e. Mahalanobis Distance)
* In general scrubbing and working with non-ideal datasets
* Exploring gradient boosting frameworks like XGBoost, grid-searching, evolutionary algorithms (TPOT), different types of neural networks
* Introducing new, calculated features in the dataset
* Using domain knowledge of the industry to maximize likelihood of success

I thoroughly enjoyed the work, whether it be exploring new concepts, meeting and setting expectations, deploying a model in production, etc.  Moreover, I enjoy a very results-driven work environment, which suggests industry is for me more than academia.  With this in mind, how should I transition?  Is a masters/phd appropriate to breakout into this field, or would it be more appropriate (or even possible) for me to try to breakout into industry right out of undergraduate?  If so, should I try to pursue an undergraduate internship specifically about data science?

If anyone could share their experience and advice, it would be greatly appreciated.",datascience,1577808266,ThirtyIncoming,1,1,True,2019-12-31

Help on Creating a Reactive Excel Sheet,"Good afternoon guys and Happy New Year,

I'm working with a sales team in my city where they operate in Business to Business sales, trying to offer the best rates on shipping routes for truckers and trucking companies.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is that with management, quotes for a price on routes change on a day to day basis.  The only way their sales force can get updated quotes is through real-time which deals with waiting in line outside the manager's door and trying to run around the facility trying to find him, which is inefficient for the sales team.

&amp;#x200B;

Or sending the manager an email to request for the day's quote, unique to their own route.  But that's inefficient to the manager because he can't spend all day on his phone or computer answering separate emails.

&amp;#x200B;

What I am thinking of is being able to create a spreadsheet that is updated on real time, where it is accessible simply through their networks on a local drive.  This will also be able to collect data for each individual sales rep and track daily routes and rates, something they have not been able to streamline.

The problem I face is two things, having the excel file only be able to be a one way street.  Meaning, the Sales rep can only create an input of the desired quote, maybe be able to answer a series of questions, and it will output that day's quote.  The manager will be able to control the daily quotes, by opening the Master Excel file he only has access to and update the quotes as he sees fit.

&amp;#x200B;

My vision is to be able to have the foundation of an online shopping cart.  Like you know when you shop online on Amazon, you click on the items you want, add them to your shopping cart, and it will give you a quote for the price.  It's reactive and done in real time, where the only control you have is selecting what you want.  You have no control of the actual pricing.  The pricing is controlled by ""upper management"".

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think this is too ambitious, correct me if I'm wrong.  I want to keep it around Excel as I want to minimize the learning curve of introducing a new software to a team, as Excel is a software everyone is familiar with.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, my only problem is, closing that gap between having a separate Excel file all sales reps will have control of, and the Master Excel file only the manager will have control of, where the Master Excel file dictates what the Rep's Excel sheets sees.

Data Science Hype,"Firstly, Happy New Year! I'm excited to see what 2020 will bring us! 

What is r/datascience's opinion on the Data Science hype? Here are my thoughts from 2019.

I've seen a lot of young college graduates fresh from their undergraduate degrees take bootcamps or coding stints in short bursts of time and land Data Science position. Honestly, well done. That's a huge achievement!! 

However, I see too often very under-experienced Data Scientists. In certain companies, maybe this is all they need: clean a few data sets here and there, build a few models and crunch numbers. I'm going to share my short-lived experience, and what I've gathered so far. this is by NO MEANS conclusive, just an observation as of yet, and I'm very interested to hear what experienced Data Scientists have to say. 

I have a background in Bioinformatics and Mathematics, I specialized in Statistical Learning and Machine Learning where I studied gruesomely to get where I'm at in my Data Science career. I work now as a consultant, and prior to this working for a research centre in Machine Learning. I suppose I still have a relatively academic mindset. These are the things that stand out from working with fresh Data Scientists. 

Here are a list of no-nos.

1) PCA is used ONLY for dimensionality reduction and plotting. **this is not true.** 

2) Hypothesis testing? What's that? **I've met a few of Data Scientists who do not know fundamental statistics**

3) Every data scientist has heard ""no free lunch"" however ignores that, because random forest &gt; SVM &gt; logistic regression ALWAYS. **Of course, we know there's no free lunch, but my XGBoost model is superior.** 

4) When it comes to communication. It's the same thing: ETL, clean, EDA, preprocess, model. **What about your impact, utilising analogies, how your work is useful, is your problem unique? additionally, Data Science may be hot right now and people follow the buzzwords, but they sometimes don't really know what it is, be careful with communication.**

DISCLAIMER: as of now, this is what I have witnessed. I have seen MANY amazing projects and work from Data Scientists that is so simple, clever, clear and concise.

I Self Published a Book on “Data Science in Production”,"Hi Reddit,

Over the past 6 months I've been working on a technical book focused on helping aspiring data scientists to get hands-on experience with cloud computing environments using the Python ecosystem. The book is targeted at readers already familiar with libraries such as Pandas and scikit-learn that are looking to build out a portfolio of applied projects.

To author the book, I used the Leanpub platform to provide drafts of the text as I completed each chapter. To typeset the book, I used the R bookdown package by Yihui Xie to translate my markdown into a PDF format. I also used Google docs to edit drafts and check for typos. One of the reasons that I wanted to self publish the book was to explore the different marketing platforms available for promoting texts and to get hands on with some of the user acquisition tools that are commonly used in the mobile gaming industry.

Is it worth getting a data science masters if I already have a data scientist title?,"So this might sound like a really dumb post but let me give you some background.

I graduated with a degree in physics and a minor in mathematics and computer science. After college I worked for two years at a company and eventually became a senior analyst. In doing so, I became very proficient at coding in R Python, and learned SQL as well. Eventually I started learning about various ML techniques and started digging a bit more into deep learning on my own.

I then left for a new job that offered me the title of data scientist. I think a more appropriate title would be junior or associate data scientist. While I do a lot of data modeling (various regressions and clustering algorithms), coding and product development, I don’t quite dive into deep learning or more AI driven approaches.

Because of that I feel a bit limited in terms of my skill set as a data scientist. I don’t have nearly as much time to take classes now which limits my growth as well. So I’ve been thinking of getting a masters in data science to really have a full fledged skill set, but I’m afraid to look really stupid in doing so - in that it would seem like I was never a DS in the first place.

Looking for input on the business/client side of data science,"Hello /r/datascience!  


Quick intro - I've been a software developer in some capacity for close to 17 years as of today. I've specialized in php/javascript webdev since 2008 and have been operating as CTO of a small digital agency for the past 5 years. Last summer, I decided I was in need of a major career shift and have since been studying and preparing myself to work in data science after tumbling down the rabbit hole of deep learning following a read-through of François Chollet's excellent *Deep Learning with Python*.  


My plan is to position myself into a data science/AI consultant role to get started and see where the winds lead me. As a business owner for a number of years, I've come to enjoy the freedom of running my own ship so keeping that independence is important to me and as such, I am not looking to lock myself in a permanent position for an employer.   


I would like the input from other people working as contractual consultants as to the business/client side of things. Data science is a very broad and complex topic, how do you explain it to the average small business owner, to a c-suite exec or even to marketing types to get them interested in working with you and exploring what data science has to offer? How do you explain the value of using data to get business insights in simple and accessible terms? What are some interesting and easy to understand parallels you can draw from what data science is to the daily activities of a small business? How would you convince a small business owner to start collecting data and that doing so is gonna be very valuable in the future?

However I am feeling a bit lost in where to begin. Do you think this is a rational target for achieving without a computer science background? Is it worth paying for PRO in Codecademy to follow a Data Science course and learn SQL, NumPy etc. through these courses? Are there any other course options that you would recommend? In R it is easy to reach for courses as the community is Open-source oriented and are motivated to teach others for free. How is it for Python and related libraries?

Studying Data Science?,"So Im just going to start off by saying that Iam a German Data Science student who is currently in the end of his third semester. Data Science is a completely new field in Germany and I actually havent met a single person that knew about it. Also Im the first course of studies at my University since Data Science just got introduced. Of course I did some research before starting my bachelor and Data Science sounded like an amazing, future oriented field that could become huge in a few years. 

So I was pretty hyped not gonna lie.

The problem Iam having right now is that what Iam doing atm is no way near what  I thought Data Science is about since theres no single analytical aspect. Its pretty much 75% maths. Im fine with maths but its honestly not what I want to think about all day because there just no creative freedom. So right now Iam wondering if it wouldnt been a better choice to choose studying Computer Science. 
Is there anybody that also made the decision to directly go into Data Science instead of firstly doing something more general?

Developing open-source forecasts for others to use,"I've worked in Bayesian time series analysis / forecasting and have found that it can be challenging to develop well-calibrated, reliable forecasts. I'd like to develop a server / web app that provides these forecasts to companies or organizations which are either too small or too isolated to do this on their own. I'd like your input on what sorts of quantities you think businesses and other organizations would like to know but have trouble predicting on their own!

For example, an airline company in a developed, western economy might have several staff devoted to forecasting prices of oil or exchange rates over a 12 month span so that they can appropriately hedge their risk by buying the right amount of jet fuel or splitting their cash across currencies. A smaller company in the developing world might want to do the same thing but don't have in-house forecasters capable of doing this. I would like to note that these sorts of predictions don't necessarily need to have low absolute error but they do need to properly characterize the variance of these predictions over the appropriate time horizon.

What is best clustering algorithm to identify clusters and compare each individual response from a survey to determine the closet cluster the response near?,"Hi, 

I have a survey where each question is related to a different 'shopper' type . Each question is either binary (True/False) or range based. 

IE:
1. Do you like to shop at our physical location store ? (True/False)

2. Do our discounts entice you to shop more? 
    a. no
    b. maybe
    c. yes


For each response I convert the answer choice to a numerical value. So True becomes 1, answer choice 2C becomes 3. 

At this point, I am clueless as too what clustering algorithm to use so I can create clusters for each of the 'shopper' type and measures each individual survey response submitted to determine a single cluster closet to the responses given and label the response as that cluster. 

IE. This individual that submitted the response is  'location conscience shopper type'

As for the second sentence: of course there's a shortage of expedience people in an industry where you need to get experience to become established. What makes that different from literally any other industry? 

Maybe most of the people in the first category include people in BI/analytics trying to become scientists, but I'm wondering where that places people still in undergrad with degrees like CS/Math.

Bernhard Schölkopf's group vs. a non-ML group at ETH Zurich for a Masters thesis.,"I have two MS thesis offers, both in core-ML topics.

One is at a non-ML group at ETH Zurich, though the PhD candidate who will be supervising it is very much a core-ML guy.

The other is at Max Planck Institute (MPI), in Schölkopf's group. The supervisor will be by an assistant prof. equivalent researcher in the group.

Some context - I'm doing my Masters in Germany and have to decide between a thesis at one of these two venues. I would like to try and at least submit (if not publish) a top-tier paper towards the end of the thesis. Both potential supervisors have an adequate track-record of publishing at ICML/NIPS/ICLR . After graduation I am interested in either good ML PhD programs or R&amp;D positions at FAANG(-ish) companies. I would also not mind a more ML Engineer/ Data Scientist role in a product team as well at such companies (it all depends on what kind of offers I get after graduation, or if I even get any offers to begin with :P ).

The question - which thesis should I go with? I think it really comes down to ""prestige"" of ETH vs. quality research of MPI-IS. The very reason I am asking this question is because most (read all) fellow students I have talked to (although most don't have a focus in ML research) do not recommend MPI over ETH (no matter how good the research at MPI is). Of course such a question is irrelevant if I only want to pursue a PhD, but what concerns me is that employers will view it similarly.

So my approach has always been, what is it that we need to solve? But, what they are saying is not what they necessarily want. And what typically happens is the end users change their minds.

Need Career Advice,"Hi all,

I am writing this post in the hopes of receiving some career advice as I am not sure where to go from here.

In the past 2.2 years I have had 4 jobs,
My first job was severely underpaid (minimum wage in my country) but I took it to gain experience, after 6 months my contract was made permanent but 2 months after I left for a bigger company with a big pay rise.

My role at this company ended after 6 months because there were a lot of difficulties with granting me permission to use the correct tools. Even though I was assessed on my knowledge of Python, R and SQL during the interview process the IT team (who was outsourced) wouldn't let me use any of these tools and expected me to analyse GBs of data using Excel. We (myself and my manager) also found out the IT team were sending us incorrect data as they believed we shouldn't have access to the proper data and instead only representations if it.

After this role ended I was hired as a contractor for 4 months whilst I prepared to move country...

I got a job with a startup and my contract was made permanent after only a month, unfortunately after 8 months the company went into trouble and the CEO laid ofd all the DS department and now I don't have a job again. He told us that he ""rushed into data science without really thinking about wether he needed it"".

I am absolutely fed up and incredibly scared I now look like a job hopper. I have references from all my jobs but I just feel so down about the lack of job security. I want to leave Data Science but don't know what else to do as I've only ever worked in this field.

"How does your team manage projects and tasks, and document code, results and other deliveries?","I work in a small team of 4 analysts\\data scientist. Among our very varied tasks are maintaining our predictive models, some reporting, some building and maintaining analytics datamarts, ad hoc analysis on demand from people in the organization, often resulting in a presentation and\\or a maintained report, occational technical creating POCs for new services, etc. 

These tasks are often somewhat unstructured. We have no ""hub"" to keep track of everything, save for some powerpoints and excel files where we try to update status. But it is very difficult to find out exactly what everyone is doing, and where the files or programs, reports, etc are located. So if someone gets sick, it is really hard to step in and complete the work. 

We have occationally tried creating more structure. Sharepoint, Trello boards, excel files, folder structures, without finding a sollution that ""sticks"". Things often get to fragmented, with trello canbans beeing to detailed and detached from the rest of the projects, and where people dont end up updating progress in several different sollutions. 

In my head, I can sort of see how we could have a central hub with all our projects (e.g. Confluence ), past and present. Where each task or project has a short description, with a link to the program files (often sas or python scripts), the resulting powerpoint presentation, or to the web report. That way, if I need to see what we have done a subject before, I can easilly find both the description of the project, the code, and the result.

How does your team mangage projects and tasks? Do you have central hub, or is everything in structured enough folders to keep things in order? Is code saved on folders\\fileshares, or uploaded to git or similar repos?

Data science ideas,"  My gift to uninspired people ! 

Here is the list that I had no time / effort practicing, you can find a dataset yourself and play with it. You can even turn it to a solution that people would need.

* Detecting cigarette stubs: Based on a strong image recognition model, a cleaning machine would enter even a nice garden to spoof stubs without messing plants.
* Open chat-room (like IRLs) with fresh topics: Topics would be inferred using topic modeling (unsupervised learning). New topics would be learned from passed discussions for a limited window (say one day).
* Time suggestion for frequent phone calls: Using history of calls (succeeded, and missed calls) of different communication solutions (WhatsApp, Viber, phone...); Learn a model to suggest a better timing . It would be very useful when peers are in different time-zones.
* Un-Tic: Train a model to discover repetitive -not successful tasks-; Tasks are actions a developer attempted on his IDE ( intellij, eclipse...) but didn't produce anything; As an example, add a line then remove it. I am sure developers do dozens of actions that are just Tics. I do myself add a line then remove it, refresh a project two times, etc. As you can imagine, this would be a plug-in in famous IDEs.

Propensity to buy a certain product or uplift scores - best algorithms?,"We would like to market a certain product at work via email. Let's call it product X. 

Some of our customers already use product X, so a good approach is to use these customers to find lookalikes in the group that hasn't bought this product. 

What kind of algorithms would people recommend for this project? 

I've looked at a few ready made packages for propensity scores/uplift modeling such as CausalLift [https://github.com/Minyus/causallift](https://github.com/Minyus/causallift) and CausalML [https://github.com/uber/causalml](https://github.com/uber/causalml), but the documentation is very light and I can't find any decent tutorials online. These packages also need info on whether a customer received a ""treatment"" or not. The customers who already use product X never received any sort of treatment (i.e. marketing) for this product. 

Before I invest possibly days into figuring out an approach for this, I just thought I'd ask here if anybody has any recommendations on how to find the best group to target. For example find the possibility of customer ABC buying product X based on customers who already use product X. 

My instinct is to just have the target variable as ""uses product X"" yes or no. Their various demographic data and transaction history as features. Then just train test split and try various sklearn models to generate a probability that the customers will purchase the product. 

Any help appreciated.

Need help understanding a paper utilizing graph theory for someone with no knowledge," Hi, I am a first year student who has been tasked with building an application to solve 3D knapsack problems. The container is 16.5m long, 2.5m wide and 4.0m high. We are given 3 parcels of different types, A:1x1x2, B:1x1.5x2, C:1.5x1.5x1.5

Each parcel has a certain value (default is A:3, B:4, C:5). We are meant to compute a packing that maximized total value. Also to answer the question of whether it is possible to fill the cargo space without any gaps.

After looking at different types of papers I found this: [https://www.ibr.cs.tu-bs.de/users/fekete/hp/publications/PDF/1997-A\_New\_Exact\_Algorithm\_for\_General\_Orthogonal\_D-Dimensional\_Knapsack\_Problems.pdf](https://www.ibr.cs.tu-bs.de/users/fekete/hp/publications/PDF/1997-A_New_Exact_Algorithm_for_General_Orthogonal_D-Dimensional_Knapsack_Problems.pdf) which looks interesting to me. From what I understand it takes a packing then if it meets those 3 conditions (P1,P2,P3) then it is a valid packing. I understand the projection onto each axes and the creation of the interval graphs, it then takes the complement of those graphs then makes it directed (I don't understand that process). So each graph for each axes has a certain number of transitive orientations and the combination of each of those orientations shows all of the packing patterns? How do you convert from the final interval graph (V,F1) into a packing?

That is really as far as I can understand, the rest of the paper . I have some people in my group who are more well verse in some of the computer science aspects but not the graph theory. Any help would be appreciated understanding it, also because I am curious about how the mechanics of this work.

"Looking for a method that's similar to exploratory/multiple factor analysis, principle component analysis, etc.","Let's say this is the sample data:

About IBMs Data Science Certification,"Yesterday, there was a top post on this sub on 30day trial IBM gives for its [data science courses, specializations and certs](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science). I looked at it, saw 4.6 and 4.7 star averages and courses with interesting titles and syllabus so I decided to take it and try to power finish it, since I already have some experience.

So I finished first two courses and boy oh boy - what a disaster. It is well expected for this kind of cert to force you use ecosystem of the provider being that google, amazon, IBM or whoever. However, you would expect it to be a WORKING environment. Everything is so outdated in the course notes, software looks nothing like in instructions, some of it even got completely revamped. There are issues with account creation, 503 server response everywhere, loading times in scale of minutes and so on.

At first I thought it was me, my system or location issues, but then you open forums and see hundreds or thousands of complaints that reach back to beginning of 2019 or end of 2018 even. There are band-aid fixes that are sometimes provided, but something that worked 8 months ago doesn't work now since something changed again. All in all a terrible experience.

All of this is just technical problems that made me tell others about this. What I will leave here without much in-depth analysis is the actual quizes and assignments, which I would call at least questionable in the sense how much someone can learn from. Sometimes it feels like it is testing your ability to use IBMs way of doing things, not the actual underlying technology.

Although I saw all this in their second course, I investigated other courses in specialization since i thought this was kind of a non essential topic (using notebooks and other resources). They all follow similar pattern with lot of people feeling disappointed and wanting their money back. From that I decided to bail from it, and felt the need to share this. All of this is easily verifiable by going to said courses, and selecting reviews - then most helpful. Who knows how these courses got such high grade average.

Data Science Career Advice (Do PhDs make one Overqualified for Data Science Positions?),"Dear all,

I'm currently undertaking an MRes (master's by research) degree in Evolutionary Biology at a Russell Group (""top 20"") University in the UK. My project involves generating quantitative leaf anatomical datasets and analysing a ton of genomic data, generating phylogenetic trees and performing positive selection analyses for certain genes. Coding in Python and R (along with basic Shell/Unix scripting) are both central to this project, and I've undertaken intensive training courses in both of these languages for my programme. Because I come from a biology background, I wanted to go into academia as a research scientist until very recently, but I have always been equally fascinated in data analysis, manipulation, mining and machine learning; and after taking these respective courses in R and Python, I've decided that I want to work as a data scientist after I leave uni. However, I've recently been offered a PhD in Germany, and the project is to my taste - in the sense that it is very bioinformatics/omics-focussed, and therefore involves dealing with a lot of big (biological) data, and has a significant ML component.

Now, my main question is, to get a job as a data scientist upon leaving uni, which qualification would be of more value: a Master's or a PhD? Would a PhD not make one ""overqualified""? Should I try and get a data science position after I finish my Master's, or is it worth doing a PhD to increase my chances of finding employment?

"Advice wanted: how would you define what is ""top performer"" from a set of data?","Still consider myself a noobie in ds here, so I may be asking a very easy and stupid question, but would really appreciate some guidance.

The hypothetical situation is that, you have a website where users write let's say movie reviews. So there are in general two types of users on your website, the ones who write normal amount like the rest of us, and the ones who write very often and are so called ""top contributors"".

Now the question is, how would you, using data, to define who are ""top contributors""?

My idea was that, we'll take the last 24 weeks (\~6 months) data, then we take the average daily contributions per user over each week, then we take average of these averages for each user. Then, with the average rate calculated, we can list out the top contributors overall or for each region. So basically:

for each user:

    daily_avg = [# of contributions]/[# of days]   where [# of days]=7 weekly_avg = [sum of daily_avg]/[# of weeks]                        where [# of weeks]=24

Deciding what to obtain a masters in.,"I am currently a mid level data scientist with about a year and a half of experience. I would like to further my education and get a masters (the actual degree is extremely important in my industry). My undergrad is a BS in Finance (I learned R during that). I would prefer to do an MS in CS or Applied stats, but I have yet to find a good, affordable online program. I found one in Data science that actually requires a background in Liner algebra, r, python, java, c++ and mangodb all of which I have experience with and has a pretty decent course load. 

My concern is it will be looked down on by anyone who doesn’t see the course work because most MS programs in data science are very fluffy.

"Data Scientists with experience in the field, Under what class do I put my current student job experience into?","So, I have been interested in data for some time now. I am currently a master's student in Germany and I am pursuing a degree that is 80% same as a computer science masters. The rest 20% has some elements of other technical subjects (i.e.) Embedded systems and so on. To give an idea of what I study, I have had 3 course for data related topics ranging from confidence intervals, linear algebra based understanding of Linear modelling and Multivariate modelling. I have also had a math course dealing with vectors, solving ODEs etc. 

So I have also been working parallely as a student at a relatively big organisation in Germany. The basic idea of the task that I have been assigned is to use Python to design scripts to work with live data and generate multiple observations from them. So my job would be to kind of take the data and put it through my script and get the requested observations from it. It can include generating scatter/bar/histogram plots ,or performing basic operations and segregating the data into different factors/levels. I mainly use pandas, numpy and matplotlib. I have to create the logic and basic algorithms for these scripts from scratch by myself and make a script out of it, so that my manager can import these scripts in his jupyter notebooks and run the data through it to get the observations he needs to do his analysis. I don't want to mention the length of my script as usually no of lines of code is a terrible way to measure complexity of the problem. 

I am not sure under what class do I put my current work as  ? Am I doing stuff related to data science, or data analytics or business analytics. 

As I am working with live data, I don't get to use machine learning to do anything. I have been teaching myself machine learning as my masters programme has no courses for it ATM. What else do you think I should focus on, in order to gain more knowledge to become successful in the field of data science ?

Which of these is the best solution for getting the dataset to automate the training in Amazon ML?,"Hello. We have in my company a semi automatized way of training models in Amazon ML, which is old and unnecessary complex and I am going to refactor it in Airflow. The dataset is obtained using a big query in Redshift, which is a join of several tables. 

For passing the dataset to AmazonML you have to create a datasource object and I think the most convenient way in my case is using the function *create\_datasource\_from\_redshift*, present in boto3 library. This function have a parameter *SelectSqlQuery* which is the important one for this discussion *.* I have came up with three different solutions:

1-. Based on what we have right now. We have a postgres RDS in which there is one table with columns ""product"", ""domain"" and ""query"", where each product and domain have the query for getting the data as a varchar. Then I would connect to the RDS, obtain the str of the query and pass it to the function.

2-. Simply pasting the entire query in the script.

3-. Creating a source table. I would execute the query and insert the result in a new table with name like source\_product\_domain. Then I would use ""select \* from source\_product\_domain"" in the selectsql parameter.

Which one do you think is the best and why? Maybe there is another solution even better, in which case I would be pleased to hear it.

Online Math-Heavy Data Science or Applied Stats Program,"I have a question that I was hoping the hive mind here might be able to help with.

I am a senior data scientist who has been in the field for several years.  I'm mostly self taught, and have worked at large  and small organizations.  My SQL and R programming skills are very strong, I've worked with some of the biggest data sets available, and can do basically whatever I need to in order to do the types of analyses that I'm asked to - which run the gamut from basic descriptive statistics to predictive models.

However, I'm starting to feel like I'm hitting a bit of a ceiling in the field due to my lack of a strong mathematical foundation.  I don't have a degree in computer science, statistics or a STEM field of any kind.  As I consider the next moves for my career, I find that many roles require a masters or PhD in a STEM field... and I find that occasionally in conversations about theory that I don't seem to have as strong as a mathematical background as other data scientists I work with.  

I've been looking at potentially going back for a graduate degree or certificate to augment my ""real-world"" skillset with more theory ... but it seems that many of the 'analytics' and 'data science' programs that exist today focus mostly on teaching basic stats and real-world data manipulation skills.  I don't need to learn how to do a linear regression model in R or how to write complicated SQL queries ... that stuff I know.   

On the flipside, more theoretical graduate programs (MS in Applied Math etc.) seem to require you to have an undergrad STEM degree.  I took Calculus I-III and one stats class but that's it - no differential equations or analysis or anything like that.

So what I'm looking for is a program with some serious coursework in probability theory, mathematical stats, etc. that I can do without literally having to go back 10 years and do college all over again.  

Does anyone here have any experience with any online graduate programs that would provide me with what I'm looking for?

Converting Text Field to Categorical Optimally,"I am a newly hired data scientist a financial services firm. I have a BS in Statistics &amp; Data Science.

One dataset with 1,000,000 rows which I have been given is mixed with the following...

Categorical features: ClientName, ServiceProvidedID, TaxReturnID, Entity, and AccountNumber, and TaxReturnGroup

Continuous features: BookBalance (in dollars)

Text features: TaxReturnSubGroup

The firm had previously used third party sources to develop a classification model where TaxReturnGroup was the target and the predictors were everything described above except TaxReturnSubGroup. This model was made so the tax workers can automate the choosing of the TaxReturnGroup for their clients based on the model predictors. They want to do the same thing for the TaxReturnSubGroup, however, this is a text field (i.e. the tax guys have been typing in this field as they see fit as there is not standard group of labels to choose from). So, they want me to find the optimal standard labels for this field to make it categorical and then iterate on their model making TaxReturnGroup an additional predictor and TaxReturnSubGroup the target classifier. 

My question...

How can I find the optimal standard labels for TaxReturnSubGroup? In other words, how can I convert a text field to a categorical field in an optimized way such that the number of categories is not too large and also the categories are granular/descriptive enough?

The initial idea they have passes on to me is to cluster the data in an optimized way (i.e. find the optimum number of clusters) and then see what kind of TaxReturnSubGroups values exist in each cluster and try to make a standard label for each cluster from there. However I am not sure what the best means to cluster mixed data is or if this is really the best route.

Starting a BSc in Data Science with the Open University. Is a BSc in DS worth it?,"I'll explain my situation a bit.
 
I don't hold an college degree. I am currently employed as a software developer and have 2 1/2 years of experience and I live in eastern europe and work at a big US tech company.
  
I wanted to get a BSc at the minimum, even though I don't think I need it anymore for employability (I've aced most of my job interviews, I tend to interview even when not planning to change jobs just for the practice and see my current market worth).
 
Since I work full time my best option was to do an online degree part-time, and based on my research the Open University is the most reputable institution for that. 

I have an interest in mathematics, and Machine Learning, and the plain ""Computing and IT"" diploma in the OU did not interest me much (I have enough experience in software engineering that I feel most of the modules would be a waste of time, and they are not cheap since I'm self financing).

This is the programme of the course: http://www.openuniversity.edu/courses/qualifications/r38

The Level 1 classes seem fairly basic (especially Introduction to computing and information technology 1 &amp; 2) but based on my research that's normal in the OU (level 1 is very basic whereas 2 and 3 ramp up considerably). 
 
Will this degree be worth anything if I actually decide to switch to work in ML or DS?
 
It's also good to note that the project I work in has a heavy data science side (It's related with fraud analytics), and I will be able to get hands on experience. 
 
If thing's don't change in the next 4 years I might wan't to do a ML masters, either in a brick university full time, or maybe I'm considering the Online master's in computer science by Georgia Tech (OMSCS). If I take that route, will the BSc give me good enough foundations to be successful at the MSc?

I'm starting on february, and could change my path to do Mathematics and Statistics instead of Data Science. The programms share a lot, however DS has ""Applied statistical modelling"" and ""Machine learning and artificial intelligence"" as modules which Mathematics and Statistics does not have.

Hyperparameters for Word2Vec for SMS corpus...,"Hey all, 

Working at a small startup, and we have extracted 33 million text messages from our users. We plan to create a model to classify different types of sms relevant to us. 

First step is to create a Word 2 Vector dictionary for EDA and clustering and possibly to use these embeddings for classification further down the line .

Just wanted some guidance about the hyperparameters for the gensim's Word2Vec. 

The corpus is 33 million sms, average sms length is 16 words and the vocab size is 1.5 million. 

I used the following hyperparameters and obtained decent results but just wanted to know if I'm doing anything wrong that could be hampering the model from performing even better:

Cbow, window = 4, vector size = 125,  iterations =10, workers = 5. 

Furthermore does anyone have any tips on how to evaluate the embeddings ( other than checking that the similarity for a small set of words makes sense) so that I can fine-tune these hyperparameters? 

And final question ( I promise) Would it possible or recomendable to take a pre trained Word2Vec model and improve on it by giving it the sms data so that it learns new words like slang and typos without losing its overall knowledge of the language?

Is it right time to transition to data science from data analytics consulting?,"So dear fellow data science enthusiasts, I currently work for a data analytics based consulting company. I do consulting work for one of the top 3 credit card issuers of USA (any guesses..). We mainly advise our client on strategies best for optimising profitability and reducing losses in the credit card business based on data analytics. I use mainly SAS/SQL and excel combined with business aptitude to narrow down on our solutions.

Well the reason for writing this post is because of my struggle to decide whether I should devote my time and energy to learn python/machine learning/deep learning on my own time or continue the line of work which will ultimately transition into a business role as i climb up the corporate ladder.

Let me just explain a bit of reasoning behind my struggle.
1) Currently, I have the credit card domain knowledge (banking jargons, well they do mean sth) which in itself is very valuable across banks/lending institutions.
2) No cutting edge models are in place in US lending business because of regulatory issues, but this is bound to change sometime in the future and I do not want to get fired if any recession/down sizing happens.
3) I have the fear of being left out when the whole world is transitioning into the complex world of data science and devising unique ways to reduce 'cost functions' where the only USP i have is the domain knowledge na dplaying with Excel pivots.
4) I can also counter-argue against my own above point that by the time complex data science catches up in the banking sector, I will be high up the ladder enough not to get affected by this (ever see the AVPs, VPs of consulting firms/banks, they don't know what a L1/L2 regularisation is). 

I guess the problem really boils down to business side vs core technical side. I would really appreciate quality 'consulting' into my own professional life from fellow redditors. Feel free to ask anything.",datascience,1574592910,geekinside18,8,1,True,2019-11-24

However, I always struggle with that there are very few online-data versions of standard data science algorithms. A simple example, the Wikipedia article for Histograms lists something like 6 different methods on how to choose the best bin width, including one for non-uniform bins, but they all assume you have the totality of the data already that you can do a run over. I can try to create online version myself (e.g. by bin splitting etc), but I would like to use some math-vetted algorithms that are optimal in some sense.
From my experience, the more advanced tools (neural networks etc) are even worse in that regard, they usually presume large amounts of existing data.

This course will survey modern numerical methods for computing solutions to parabolic, elliptic, and hyperbolic partial diﬀerential equations. We will mainly focus on ﬁnite diﬀerence and ﬁnite volume methods. Solution methods for nonlinear PDEs will be emphasized. Major applications will include: • heat (diﬀusion) equation forward and backward Euler, TR, and TRBDF2 methods • semiconductor process simulation (nonlinear diﬀusion) TRBDF2 method • Poisson’s equation (electrostatics) direct solvers

Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, SOR, and PCG iterative methods • drift-diﬀusion model and ionic ﬂow in biological cells • wave equations upwind, Lax-Friedrichs, and Lax-Wendroﬀ methods • Burgers’ equation

• gas dynamics and supersonic astrophysical jets Lax-Wendroﬀ and WENO methods • semiconductor device simulation (electro-gas dynamics) • Navier-Stokes equations (incompressible ﬂuid dynamics) Chorin projection method

OR THEORY OF PDE'S

This course introduces rigorous methods to study partial diﬀerential equations such as existence theory and global behavior of solutions. The goal is to understand intuitively PDEs and then to learn analytic tools to prove results. This class is intended to focus mainly on linear PDEs (e.g. elliptic, parabolic equations) but if time allowed some techniques used for non-linear PDE will be introduced (e.g. ﬁxed-point methods).

See for instance: http:// [seb-motsch.com/geek/pde\_solver\_flex.html](https://seb-motsch.com/geek/pde_solver_flex.html)

The course will be divided into four parts: a) Review (chap. 2.1-2.3): we will review some examples of PDEs with explicit solutions and study formally their behaviors. b) Functional analysis (chap. 5.2-5.7): from Lp to Sobolev spaces H1 (where do solutionsofPDEslive?),approximationbysmoothfunctions,compactness,Sobolev inequality... c) Elliptic PDEs (chap. 6): solving boundary value problem (i.e. ∆u = f). d) Evolution equations (chap. 7): solving hyperbolic/parabolic PDEs: ∂tu+c·∇xu =∆xu. • If time allows, a short introduction to techniques used for non-linear PDE will be presented.",datascience,1574622368,derivsonata,2,1,True,2019-11-24

Is it common at all for a Data Scientist to be a Data Analyst in disguise?,"Curious, just because of how fluid these two positions can be and how both positions can have different scopes of responsibilities depending on the company size, industry, etc.

I assume that in the first scenario, the Data Scientist only has to do more of the Analyst-type work because the company is large and has multiple DS in the team and delegates accordingly. And then the latter being an Analyst at, say a small or startup-ish company that can't afford a big Data team and so that one ""Analyst"" has to do everything (as much as he's capable of).

Python programming 
Front end web visualization (HTML/CSS)
Fundamental statistics
Databases (MySQL and Mongo)

Advanced topics (tableau, Hadoop and machine learning). 

At the end as part of the course we will also work on a project that will be added to a portfolio. 


My background is in chemistry (Bs) and pharmacology (Ms) and I am currently working in the pharmaceutical industry. I have very little coding experience but the boot camp is tailored towards beginners like me.

New idea to prevent customer churn with machine learning.,"This project provides a real solution for companies which suffer from churn. Nowadays, many entrepreneurs have tended to use the ML model to detect client with bad behavior in order to give them new offers and opportunities convince them not to leave.

However it still very difficult to protect the company's customer and give the the most adaptable offer with the lowest cost.

Guidance for data normalization when fetching data from multiple platforms," 

Hi People, 

I'm working on a startup, I have created a reporting tool that accumulates data from 20 different platforms. 

Currently, I’m providing an on-demand solution where I fetch data from APIs whenever a report needs to be generated. 

I want to expand the number of platforms multifold, approx 100. 

Apart from data analytics, I want to provide other advanced features like clubbing data from different platforms, data comparison between platforms, etc. 

To achieve that scale, based on my research and understanding I realized that I need to normalize the data I receive from APIs and store it in my database to provide data analytics on the data apart from just reporting. 

Currently, my application is built on MEAN stack.  

What are the tools/databases I can use to normalize and save the data, are there any predefined standards or basic things which I need to keep in mind before approaching to solve the problem? Is data normalization the right approach or is there any better way?

Those of you who have previously worked on such data analytics tools, your feedback would be very valuable to me.",datascience,1574704825,dilator,2,1,True,2019-11-25

Sampling question for predictive models,"I’m trying to build a logistic model that predicts whether a customer will respond to an annual direct mail campaign. Let’s say I have historical data for 3 years of data for a total of 60,000 mails to 40,000 unique individuals (since some customers were part of more than one campaign).

For features, I created some calculated variables like number of transactions and average transaction value in the last year at the time of the mailing date.

My question is whether it’s okay to treat each mailing as a row of data for building the model. So for example one customer might be represented in two rows as shown below. The value of the variables are different since it’s being calculated at the time of the campaign. This way I would have more data for building the model and it also captures the dynamics of customer behavior.

|Campaign|Date|Name|\# of Transactions in last 365 days|Avg Transaction Value|Response|

|A|2016-01-01|John Smith|3|$50|Yes|
|B|2018-01-01|John Smith|0|$0|No|

Engineering student seeking help with data analysis,"Hi everyone, not sure if this is the proper place for this sort of thing, but here goes:

I’m an engineering student. My partner and I are doing an assignment for my data acquisition class in which we are to measure the spin decay of a yo-yo. We have two sensors: a load cell for measuring the impulse of each throw, and a remote optical sensor to get the RPM.

The problem: we used the only load cell available to us: a 50lb load cell. It turns out since the yo-yo is so light, the impulses we got are barely distinguishable from the noise we see in the data. Visually, you can see where the impulses occur, but the actual value has to have quite a bit of error in it due to the amount of noise. Correct?

Is there a way to, mathematically or otherwise, analyze this thing and get meaningful data out of it?

Anyone want to do a project together?,"I've been doing a project aimed at helping students utilize data to boost their ACT (American College Test scores). If you want to hope over to r/ACT, the second pinned post is actually my post about the project.

The main questions I am trying to answer is:

* What is the most effective way to study to optimize points on the ACT?
   * Is there skill overlap between subjects (will studying for only one subject correlate with a point increase on another subject)?
* How honest are people when they post scores on the internet? How high does the online ACT community ([r/ACT](https://www.reddit.com/r/ACT/) and the ACT Discord) score?
* How does participating in accelerated programs, participating in sports, taking a second language, and other factors influence your score?

In addition, this project will require some advertisement analysis to find the most effective way to spread the word. I will get the data from online surveys - I've already received 120 or so submissions.

Failed a job interview - Was my approach wrong?,"So I currently work as a data scientist, and I recently failed a data science job interview at a large professional services firm. 

The feedback from my interview was that I came across very well, but that I failed on the technical test.

The technical test was to do a Powerpoint presentation of how I would deduplicate a dataset of 10 million rows which contains information such as name, address ect. My approach was to preprocess the data, split it into chunks, deduplicate a chunk, and then systematically compare the deduplicated chunk with other chunks, and iterate the same process through the remaining chunks.

In the feedback from the interview they said the main reason why I failed is that for the within-chunk-deduplication and comparison-with-other-chunks parts of the process I used a [pre-built package](https://recordlinkage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about.html#introduction) rather than building one from scratch myself.

To me, building one myself is a waste of time, as I would just be recreating something that already exists. But obviously they thought I did the wrong thing.

Regression where 99% of target is 0,"The purpose of this post is conversational. I have a regression project I'm about to dive into and I have some nuances around it and some different approaches that I'm considering. So, I wanted to put them out there and see what others think or how they would tackle this problem.

I'm working with app data. When someone installs the app we hope that they become a spender. 

The goal is to build a model to predict 30 day spend based on in app activity after 7 days. For simplicity say there are two predictors only, time spent in total within the first 7 days and then any spend after 7 days. Based on these two data points can we predict what spend will be after 30 days.

The part I'm grappling with in my mind is that suppose only 1% of users ever spend at all. So my data set is heavily skewed.

Here's some approaches that I'm thinking of:

1. Ignore that skew and just build a model anyway. The majority of cases will have 0 for the second predictor '7 day spend'. This approach is appealing because it's simple and requires less work.
2. Use upsampling to pull up more spenders in my training set. This is appealing because in r's caret package, it's as simple as adding a single parameter to train().
3. Build two models. First take those players with any spend after 30 days and build a regression model based on their day 7 behaviors as discussed above.   
Then, for the larger group of non spenders build a classification model with a binary outcome of spend/not spend after 30 days. Then, for each install take the predicted probability of spend and multiply by the regression output for a user with the same level of engagement in terms of time spent in the app. This approach is more work and might get more complicated so it's less appealing, however it 'feels like it might be a more comprehensive approach to handle the large group of non spenders.

What are some ways of handling large skew in regression modeling where the vast majority of cases are 0?

Data Science tools and methods for customer / transaction data?,"I'm currently working with two datasets (real world)

One is customer demographics, such as age, gender, and various census data on their immediate neighborhood.  I've been able to cluster the data based on these census demographics into poor, affluent, student communities, young families etc. and apply these labels to each customer.

The other dataset is their transactions. The transactions are at the store level e.g. spent $20 in this cafe, $50 in this store and so on, so unfortunately I can't really do any sort of market basket analysis or recommend specific products. I could probably build a recommender system based on stores, but I'm not sure if that's commonly done. Every single tutorial I've seen has been at the product level.

I'm just wondering if there are any tools you guys would recommend that I explore in a marketing/customer transaction context.

At the moment I've explored the python lifetimes library: [https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/lifetimes](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/lifetimes) to estimate probability of churn, future purchases and customer lifetime value. Very easy to use library with promising results and will stay in my toolkit.

I've also segmented the customers based on RFM scores, didn't take very long to do. However something in the back of my head is telling my this is way too simple. 

I've also attempted to build a churn model based on customers who have closed their accounts (4% of the dataset), but results are terrible. I even stuck the data into three different autoML platforms and spent days on feature engineering. I'm getting terrible f-scores. The churn label is very difficult to predict, maximum correlation between variables and churn label is about 0.2.

Anyway, to cut it short: for those in a marketing/data science/data analyst background - any tools/libraries/models you would recommend?

Topological data analysis provides performance boosting features for finding signals hidden in noise,"Your task is to recover a binary signal (like a morse code) from a noisy time series. What features do you use to recover the signal. In our article on [towards data science](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-shape-that-survives-the-noise-f0a2a89018c6) we show that TDA features not only outperform standard features, they also create performance boosting information not available in standard methods.

The [code](https://github.com/giotto-ai/noise-to-signal) is available on [Giotto'](https://giotto.ai)s [gitHub](https://github.com/giotto-ai/giotto-learn). The TDA features rely on the Taken's embedding of the times series, and from there we run the persistence diagram algorithm on top of each time window. Since the persistence diagram is not a vector we create a series of machine learning friendly features: 

\-relevant holes

\-amplitude of the diagram

\-mean support

Advice on Data Science Bootcamp for Bay Area Data Science job?,"Hi all,

I graduated from UCB as a Business Administration undergrad in 2015, and since then have been doing a slew of different jobs ranging from production planning, project management, negotiating/purchasing, and some analytics on the side. Over the years my job has become less analytic, and more about driving results on timelines and keeping the project on schedule. I've realized in the last year how much I miss spending my days in spreadsheets to find business insights.

I've recently been considering Galvanize Bootcamp as a way to grow my analytical toolset and pursue a data science career. In the past, I've used SQL &amp; Excel for the analytic projects I've done. 

Does anyone have any insight into how valuable a Galvanize bootcamp graduate is in the Bay Area? I was unable to find recent reviews of the program, though the posts from 2-3 years ago seem positive for the most part. 

I am taking the Galvanize prep class in my spare time, and really enjoying it, but wondering if the high price of the bootcamp will be able to give me a good return on my investment, as I will be funding the program myself and not receiving employer support. What do Bay Area employers think of the Galvanize bootcamp? Are there other recommendations to kickstart my data science career?

Appreciate any help you can give!

How to approach this project of clustering event sequences,"I have a number of files, each of which contains a sequence of events along with what time each happened. Each event can occur multiple times in one file. The files can vary greatly in number of events, frequency of events, and total time span.

The data in each file looks something like this:

Event\_A 0:02

Event\_C 0:07

Event\_C 0:09

Event\_E 0:15

Event\_B 0:20

Event\_A 0:34

Event\_G 1:12

I want to find clusters of similar files. By “similar” I mean the same type of events occurring at similar times and in similar orders. For example, if both file 1 and file 2 have event A occurring around 1:00 and event B around 3:30, they’re considered similar. If file 3 has event A around 1:00 and event B around 5:00, it’s less similar to file 1 and 2.

My main questions are:

1. How to structure the data for clustering analysis? Most examples are tabular, but my data is not.  I thought about something similar to a document term matrix, with each file as a row and each event as a column. However, it seems difficult to capture the time and order of events.
2. What kind of algorithm can I use to find clusters?
3. I would like to weight the events so that the earlier an event is the more important it is in determining similarity. So for example if file 1 and 2 are identical for the first 5 minutes, but differ greatly after 5 minutes I would like them to be considered very similar.",datascience,1575013039,g3rain1,2,1,True,2019-11-29

Using Shap Values to Interpret Model Performance,"Paper Abstract: 

Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction’s accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.

Some ML applied to a bioinformatics problem," Hello all,  
 I’m really hoping the community will be able and willing to offer so much needed guidance.  
 I’m helping a friend with the technical components of an analysis  (mostly bioinformatics) but it seems that we will also be needing some  machine learning assistance to solve this.  
 I have the following data for each subject:   
 •    survey results (age, demographic, zip code, and various category selections)  
 •    measurement results (numerical) + specific label/categorization (call it K)  
 •    an OTU table (count of distinct bacterial species, subject ID in columns, bacterial species as rows)  
 Ultimately, I am trying to achieve the following:  
 •    correlate a subject's signature, based on survey results and OTUs to a specific K  
 •    find the optimal number of K’s

What tools do you use for creating NLP datasets?,"**TL;DR:** what tools do you use to classify and manage in-house NLP datasets?

I've figured my team is spending a lot of time labelling datasets in somewhat inefficient ways. It happens in Jupyter notebooks (through once-off programmed widgets) or exporting to Excel and back, which is fine but inefficient. For example, having to choose which label is correct among 100 labels is difficult and visually impossible in Excel. It'd be great if some other model ordered these options upfront (I am aware of the bias).

Since I am the one who usually helps them with tools like that, I'd like to see what you use for such tasks before I present them different options.

**We usually work on:**

* text classification
* text annotation
* search results quality evaluation.

Ideally, it would manage datasets and have them available through API so we can spend some time labelling and then just doing something like \`toolx.datasets.fetch(name)\` and use it in Jupyter.

I am not asking for the perfect tool but your experience on tools and workflows you use within your team/company. I've found [Prodigy](https://prodi.gy/) (from Spacy makers) and meaning to try it, but from the outside it seems to lack something that will help us with search results evaluation and it generally steers towards binary choices, which is not always suitable for what we want to do.",datascience,1575194736,derivablefunc,13,1,True,2019-12-01

Any tool / software for data preparation and / or feature selection analysis,"I just started working on a dataset to do some time series predictions. The dataset has hundreds (+- 400) columns, and there has to be done some proper data cleaning.

The best way to start working on this probably is looking to the raw data and start fixing the data types, deleting unnecessarily columns, etc. After that I'll explore the correlations between variables, you all probably know the drill.

I'm going to do the above the conventional way in R. But I was wondering, just out of curiosity, is there any tool (preferably free / open source), where I can input the data set and it will try to clean the data and search for correlations without much user input?

Obviously the ""manual"" way will offer a better result, but maybe a completely automated tool will give me some insights about the data I hadn't found myself yet.

"Leaving my ""data scientist"" role at 30 to go back to school, finish my degree, and pursue a graduate program - am I crazy?","This is a big decision for me to make, so I’m hoping you’ll bear with the length of this post and provide some solid feedback. There are several questions at the end of this post that I’m looking for concrete answers to.

**The context**

I started a specialized diploma in applied computer science in 2012, got super interested in data science and dropped out to pursue a self-study path through Coursera, just before MOOCs were mainstream. I have been working in the software industry for seven years: 3 years as a software engineer and 4 years as a data scientist. Unfortunately, I’ve been the only data scientist in the three different organizations I’ve been employed at and haven’t had the opportunity to grow as a professional data scientist (which isn’t to say I have grown as a data scientist or professionally).

Within a professional context, I have learned a lot about business, business and data strategy, scoping data problems, and software development and have had the opportunity to work on a lot of end-to-end data problems (none of which made it to production). Ultimately, I don’t feel like I’ve delivered much tangible value to the organizations I’ve worked at while in a data scientist role. My work has mainly positioned them well with POCs and educated them on internal and customer-facing use cases. I’ve also never had anyone validate my approaches or results - the closest I get are responses from the online community to questions I post when I’m really stuck.

Over the past few years, my understanding of applied predictive analytics (ML in the context of real world problems) and inferential statistics has improved mostly from countless hours of learning concepts and speaking with business stakeholders. It pains me to say I’ve completed a total of three portofolio-worthy projects which are mediocre at best (e.g. achieving an F1-Score of .73 on a real-world multi-class classification task I completed for work) and have only participated in two Kaggle competitions, ranking low on the leaderboards. I’m totally aware that more of my time should have been spent completing projects and building my portfolio rather than learning. Reflecting on my interest in learning over implementing has hinted toward the fact that I will probably enjoy a career in research.

So all of this, coupled with a strong interest in AI (more agent-based models rather than DNNs, like the content in AIMA by Norvig and Russel), statistics, biology, math, and solving hard problems has me seriously considering going back to school to complete an undergrad then post-grad programs. I’m sure being jaded has something to do with it, but I’ve become quite depressed at thought of the path I’m on, being stuck in this data science-team-of-one-with-no-production-projects role. Even if I get to do ""real"" data science, I don’t like the thought of working directly on impacting the bottom-line. I want to do *science,* work on the cutting edge, and have a larger impact with my work. I’m fine if my work indirectly impacts the bottom line.

**The plan**

1. Completing my diploma in Q2 2020 with a comprehensive project to demonstrate my industry experience
2. Going back to school in Q3 2020 to complete my CS BSc within with stats minor in 1.5 years - 2 years (thanks to a local college / university partnership that I qualify for after completing #1)
3. Enrolling in a MSc program in 2022
4. Hopefully fast-tracking to a PhD program by 2023
5. Getting an (ideally) high-paying research position as a scientist doing work that I’m passionate about by 2028

My goal is to do applied research for a big tech firm like Microsoft, DeepMind, Netflix or a company doing precision medicine like [https://www.deepgenomics.com/](https://www.deepgenomics.com/). 

I want to clarify that my motivation for doing a PhD is not money-driven, but I am expecting that my hiatus from full-time employment for 8 years will off from a financial perspective, in the long-run. To be clear, I’m interested in a PhD because I want to be immersed in a field of study that I’m passionate about, become an expert in it, and do proper applied science in that field. I feel going back to school will also help develop my critical thinking skills which I feel could use some work.

Here is where it gets tricky:

* I’ll need to work part-time at least while I finish my undergrad degree (thinking 20 hours / week)
   * This might be possible at my current employer, definitely doable at a previous employer. Also considering freelancing on sites like Upwork.
   * My strategy is to negotiate a higher salary to offset reduced work hours.
* I want to get married and start a family within the next 5 years
   * My girlfriend and soon-to-be fiancé (she doesn’t know it yet) is ultra-supportive of this move.
* I still want to make &gt;= $150K annually (after completing my PhD) to support the lifestyle I want for me and my (future) family
* The computer science department at the nearest university doesn’t appear to have strong AI research areas (see [https://www.csd.uwo.ca/research/ai\_\_games.html](https://www.csd.uwo.ca/research/ai__games.html))

**My questions for you**

Career:

* Does this sound like a reasonable path to take, given my career trajectory to date and passion for research? Am I sabotaging my career? To provide some more context, data scientists are in low demand in the area (lots of tech companies but most are late majority / laggards when it comes to creating a DS capability) and are paid less than software engineers.
* Are there still going to be lucrative career opportunities in AI in the next five to ten years for a 37-40 year old, doing ultra-specialized work in e.g. computational genomics?
* If I complete a PhD in a focussed area like computational genomics as opposed to machine learning / deep neural nets, will the big tech companies still consider me for research positions?
* One of my biggest fears is that by the time I’m done my PhD, technology will have advanced so much that either my expertise will become outdated or the problems will have already been solved. Is this a rational fear?

Academic:

Use case:   


We are gathering data on permissions to different systems, the type of permission and have other data such as Department, title, etc; on users. Would I be able to use something like Pandas to basically say, gather the data from these columns and then make groupings on users based on their jobcode, cost center, department, group, etc. And then use the other attributes to indicate what is not common and what is common with these users.  


So if all users with a department of Sales are consider a grouping and then we take in all other data values, indicate what is common and normal for these type of users and what is abnormal. Point being that we can see where concerns are to management in business processes or even possible security issues.

When the data need is purely operational, it is easy to be data driven. Ex : if an employee X sells significantly less than the average, you can ask him why and work with him. But when it comes to high-level strategic decisions, it is a completely different game. Even if data tells that we are losing money in a product Y, if the company believes in it and sees it as the future, it will continue funding it.

Minimize Percent Difference in Regression?,"Preface - It is very likely I'm not understanding something correctly.

I'm under the assumption that an OLS regression model will not work for the predictive work I'm doing, as a residual of 5 (arbitrary unit) is much more severe closer to the origin than it is when the independent variables are larger. In other words, that residual of 5 could be 20% off or it could be 7%..

I was wondering if there were alternative methods to doing this sort of linear regression that might address this concern. Could I minimize the absolute percent difference instead, or does that introduce issues in the math? Are there entirely different ways to approach this I should read up on? Not much formal education on this, so I've been learning as issues come up..",datascience,1575465708,ComputerAries,1,1,True,2019-12-04

Convincing my data engineers to build an analytics data warehouse?,"This might be more of an /r/dataengineering question, but my new place of work has us doing all of our analytical work off of our transactional MySQL database in Amazon Aurora. Basically every other place I've done DS at has had the transactional data pipelined into a dedicated analytics data warehouse where people can then hammer the system there. 

I've talked with the team and they adamantly don't want to push the data into Redshift, but the limitations of MySQL 5.6 are truly frustrating for me tactically building datasets to use for analytics/ML. Their thought is to use Presto, but our current 4-node cluster bottlenecks pretty frequently for big data workloads. We also use Redash, which I'm not a fan of at all in terms of tactical query building / sharing / integrations with python. 

My thought is to try and sell them on a solution like pipelining our data into Google Bigquery and having that act as our analytical platform instead of people directly querying the transactional data. Their take is very likely going to be ""let's not worry about that until it becomes a problem"", but I'd like to get ahead of the problem first.

If we have ~500 analytics people on staff, expecting to grow 25% by end of next year, and only 10 data engineers on staff, am I justified in asking for this pipeline to an analytics data warehouse in the first place?

I figure even if I find myself managing a team of data scientists in the next year this doesn't help my long term trajectory in the same way a less-senior product role would. Am I wrong in thinking this? I think the longer I wait to pivot the bigger the penalty, and that leadership is less accessible from a data science manager role than product management.

Using multiclassification for binary classification?,"So I have a tabular dataset that I am using to train a GBM on and getting pretty good initial results.

The reason for this I think is because if the classifier is more confident that it *is* one of the other classes, it will accurately predict that label rather than a low-confidence false positive on the class I am interested in.

Actuary? Data Science? Masters? (ADVICE please),"Hi,

I am a final year university student in Montreal studying actuarial mathematics as my major. Recently, after 2 internships, I realized I wasn't too interested in this career path and started to look at data science. In my final year, I started taking as many courses as I could in CSci to potentially be considered for a masters in CSci and have applied to some CS Masters but from what I have been hearing, it is very unlikely I get in considering my math background, regardless of my grades.

&amp;#x200B;

So I have 3 options at this point in time that I would like help with if anyone has any suggestions. 

1) Forget Data Science or any other career path and continue as an actuary. I would really like to avoid this option but it is a safe option, good pay and I can work right after university since I have 2 internships and 3 professional exams done. The work isn't interesting to me as much as I thought it would be but if my hand is forced financially, I'll have to do this and companies will pressure to complete actuary specific exams instead of getting a masters or any other education.

&amp;#x200B;

2) Look for any other job as closely related to DSci as possible. Data analyst? Could I even do software/CS jobs? Anything else? In this case I wouldn't know how to finally end up asap in a DSci role and what kind of skills I could build without university courses. (Self-learning is good and all but a lot of companies in DSci list a Master's in CS at the top of the list)

&amp;#x200B;

3) Apply for a master's in CS and keep applying while working until I get in. I don't know how this option would work... would I just apply to my local universities in the city I find a job or do I apply anywhere and drop my job once I get in and move for my Masters?

&amp;#x200B;

Essentially, if anyone could put themselves in my shoes and let me know what you would do, I'd appreciate it. I can self learn forever but I need some kind of goal that I believe will land me a job in Data Science and without a Masters, not only do I not see it happening easily, I would guess I would also be unable to advance within any companies without a higher level of education.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm very lost on what to do next and I might have to stick to being an actuary if I  don't see a clear path with Data Science. All advice and criticism is appreciated.

Easy-to-use web-based database system for research?,"Hi all,

Novice data scientist here. I recently took a job at a university as part of a research team. The goal of our research is to combine a multitude of disparate indicators into a series of combined indexes and track these indexes over time. The previous team has stored data and done analytics within excel. Though excel has the benefit of being easy to use, the number of observations and general disorganization of the relational database files is hamstringing our research. I'm looking to migrate our data to a web-based database engine, and I'm hoping this sub could help me decide on a path forward.

Key features of the database system I'm imagining:

\-ease to learn and use: little ""coding"" beyond what would be typical in excel

\-small or no cost

\-easy query (example: easily displays ""indicator X"" for ""Australia"" for ""2008-2013""

\-easily transform data

\-popular and universal compatibility

\-desirable: visualization capabilities and website integration

Reinforcement learning for business problems?,"Hello all, in my grad program, we spent a number of lectures on reinforcement learning, DQN, etc. Every building block discussed was presented in the context of training computers to play games. It was really fascinating hearing about Alphago and similar achievements of reinforcement learning. 

Personally, I'm more interested in business applications of RL. For example, NPR's planet money (I believe) briefly discussed that RL models could be trained to recommend trades at quant funds, which is superior to simply predicting the expected future value of a stock price. 

In a more concrete example, I found a couple of papers that discussed RL as a means to solve the traveling salesman problem [see papers linked in article](https://towardsdatascience.com/reinforcement-learning-for-combinatorial-optimization-d1402e396e91). However, my grad program is much more on the applied side of DS than the theory. So I doubt I would be able to replicate the paper's architecture in python, solely based on what they've described in LaTeX.

Automate workflow for updating model results with Github Actions,"I am currently trying to automate a workflow that does the following:

The workflow can be handled fairly easy using their low res Azure containers provided by Github Actions, but when I need more processing power (more RAM and threads) it kind of falls apart.

"After being in a data science/ developer role for the better part of a decade, here is how companies REALLY develop software and AI/ML applications [OC]","Here at random.ai startup, we’re reaching our late stage of maturity as a company and I want to share some of our keys to success. At random.ai we enthusiastically follow a well-designed execution methodology that has been developed and calibrated over many years. Software development methodologies come and go, and perspectives change. We embrace the Agile SDLC. The beautiful thing about agile is to adopt it, all you have to do is say you’re agile. And the more you talk about being agile, the more agile you are.

In order to achieve lightning fast delivery speed, we jump directly into development and skip the analysis, requirements and design steps (which are common phases in other, less effective, methodologies). In order to ensure alignment and rapid cycle time, we set milestone deadlines and scope before wasting time on understanding the complexity of the business problem at hand. A key success factor is that the decision makers and product/project plan owners have little or no knowledge of the technological challenges that will be encountered during future phases. To build great technology, we strategically organize our execution teams to minimize the number of people who are writing the code. Our rule of thumb is for every one technologist (i.e. developer, engineer or data scientist), there should be at least four non-technical project team members. This will provide the necessary capacity for these additional resources to determine **what** the technologist will do, **when** they should do it by, and most importantly, **how** they should do it. An important characteristic for successful projects is for the project team to collect a backlog of diverse, unrelated, and unclear tasks and assign them to the developers the moment they think of them. The more our developers and data scientists multi-task, the more tasks can be completed.

A core priority for a sustainable revenue stream on existing products is maintenance- the time spent maintaining existing code and pipelines. Our strategy on investing in maintenance is to do none at all - we can maintain a massive pipeline of new product development by not getting bogged down and distracted doing preemptive maintenance on legacy code. We have rapid, lightweight prioritization of fixing legacy code- instead of crawling through old code that’s already working, it’s better to wait for it to break and allow our clients to discover the problem and raise it to us. This makes prioritization incredibly easy- once the problem is raised, we mobilize resources immediately to fix the problem. Again, this aligns with our philosophy that multi-tasking developers are productive developers.

We find that our most successful project teams and middle managers are always thinking of ways create value for clients faster. We even have a special phrase for these internally: ""short cuts"". So many companies fall victim to spending time building extensible, easily modifiable systems that have staying power over time. Those companies are guaranteed to never reach a billion dollar valuation. Things like robust error handling, load/unit/regression testing, modularization of code, documentation- all distractions preventing you from realizing value faster. For example, we recently had a case where we needed to implement a critical bug fix. A sales rep had the idea of a short cut that led to an incredibly fast turn-around of one week- great ideas really do come from anywhere! We know the short cut was decisively faster than the slow traditional route, because we had to do the fix to the same code three times, each took the same amount of time- one week, and the senior developer’s original estimate was two weeks! This is the out-of-the-box thinking that separates good companies from great ones.

Any competent person in the data products or AI/ML industry will tell you the same thing- having a well-thought-out data quality strategy is a survival necessity. We achieved a 100% efficiency gain in our quality assurance efforts by removing them entirely from our dev cycle. We haven’t failed a test case since the decision, and we’re getting products out the door faster because of it.

The last, but certainly not least, critical component of our execution methodology and philosophy is our talent. Our people are our greatest asset. After years of trying out different org structures- we have, what I believe to be, the truly optimal structure and our key to success is our management team. With respect to head count, we like to have as many mid-level managers as individual contributors. This ensures our individual contributors have the support they need: one half of the company is working tirelessly to support the other half who is doing actual work. Our managers really roll up their sleeves and get into the weeds- really managing all the way down at the most micro level possible.

I hope that you too can gain success using these philosophies and strategies I’ve shared. Here at random.ai, we’re excited to be disrupting the future of cloud native, deep learning powered blockchain knowledge graph data lakes - our CNDLPBKGDL offering which is releasing to beta next year. We’re disrupting the world by disrupting ourselves- because at random.ai, we're solving yesterday’s problems tomorrow, because tomorrow, today will be yesterday.",datascience,1575599018,EconomixTwist,46,1,True,2019-12-05

Some Reasons I Haven’t Found a Job,"I left a data science job at a large company to do something else tech related for a while. I’ve been looking causally for another data science gig, but I haven’t had a lot of luck finding a position or getting an offer. Here are what I think are some of the reasons why:

1. Not qualified

Usually early stage startups with a complex business. They need a unicorn that has more experience and depth of knowledge than me. I would probably love to work for whoever they hire.

2. Philosophical differences

Most of my experience is using Bayesian methods or neural networks. This has been an issue twice as some people consider these heterodox methods. That’s ok, I wouldn’t accept an offer from someone who sees things this way anyways.

3. Credentialism (generally a screening issue)

I do not have a masters degree in Data Science. I have a bachelor’s in business analytics and MIS. I have verifiable experience in launching two successful systems that were strategic enough to have C level oversight, but unfortunately no MS which is a dealbreaker for some HR screeners.

4.  Unexpected Interview Questions/Level

The latest tech interview I went into, I prepped on different analysis and testing methods. I focused a lot on multilevel modeling and made sure I could implement and explain the mcmc algorithm from scratch.

Most of the questions were about sql functions and the difference between joins. I have a DBA certification. I know all of that really well, but hadn’t prepped articulating it on the spot, so I’m sure I sounded lame explaining it.

5. Diversity &amp; Culture 

It’s a no go for me if the team is all “same dude, different guy.”

Also, if I’m gonna spend a significant amount of time with people, I want to be really sure that they are decent. This is the hardest thing to assess though.

6. Location

I do not want to live in NYC or SF, but I still want to work on something that has a good brand, real impact, and is complex. Hard to find positions like this in other cities.

It seems like my best option is to grow my skill set a bit more, or follow up with the companies that I wasn’t qualified for once they grow a little more.",datascience,1575603847,ricardusxvi,18,1,True,2019-12-05

However, even that is vague since we do not have good definitions for cognition and intelligence (at least to my knowledge). Both are useless definitions IMO, but any mention of AI oftentimes invokes thoughts of the latter when marketed to non-experts.

Is Jenks Natural Breaks optimisation appropriate for 1d data that could have only a single class?,"Hey all,

I've searched online for the answer but haven't found one. Sorry if this is really obvious, but this is my first foray into data science and I have a lot to learn! Any help is appreciated :) 

# Scenario:

My data is a 1 dimensional record of times an event occurred. The event is the click of a button. 2 people have access to this button, and I'm trying to work out which person was interacting with the button at what times.

Person A has the following behaviour:

* They tap the button quite a few times in a short period when they walk past. They'll often tap the button maybe 5 or 6 times randomly when they see it. They never tap it just once, and those taps only have a short period between them.

Person B has the following behaviour:

* They tap the button once when they go past it. They may go past it a few minutes later, and in that case they'll tap it again.

Both people can walk past this button multiple times per day at random times. Sometimes Person A will be the only one to interact with the button on a day. Sometimes Person B will be the only one to interact with the button on a day. Sometimes, they will both interact with the button on the same day.

&amp;#x200B;

So, is Jenks Natural Breaks optimisation appropriate for grouping the data? It seems like it is, but I've never seen anyone use it on data that may only have 1 class. What happens if I'm analysing a day which only sees person A touching the button? Is it going to over fit the model and split their rapid clicks into multiple classes?

That being said, my Bachelor's put no emphasis on programming, and perhaps underemphasized the math department. So I, in conjunction with my advisors, are brainstorming a bare-bones checklist of skills that could get my foot in the door (if not landing a job, at least recommending me for a Master's program.)

Basically, 10-ish must have courses I need?

HELP Fake Twitter Bot Detection Algorithm,"Hey y’all - I’ve hit a block in the road and figured I’d post my problems on here. 

TL;DR - Good sources for data visualization of tweets (in R) preferably with example source code

I’m working on a project for my math class that needs to be presented to a panel of intimidating ass, way too smart for their own good professors and I don’t want to get up there and look like an absolute pleb. 

The project: using twitter’s api to scrape tweets, I need to create an algorithm to identify tweets regarding the upcoming election as “fake or bot” accounts. I.e is this a real tweet or some fake bs a bot is spewing. 

Essentially - I have all my data tidied and ready to go (it was a real bitch). I have an already identified fake set of tweets (thank god for the person who posted that ish online), a real set of tweets from the same time frame, and a master containing both. 

I suppose my real issue and question is does anyone know a good resource or two for data visualization of twitter data (in R pls). I’m going to create linear combinations of the features in an attempt to create a scoring system, but I need to plot several different variables to see if there is a significant difference amongst the fake and real datasets to create an algorithm to test on the master.",datascience,1575686839,nstangelo,1,1,True,2019-12-06

Is Data Science really worth it?,"I am working in the Data Science department of a company. I expected it to be great, learning much, realizing cool Data Science projects. However reality is quite different: To make it short: Our **customers dont really need ""Data Science""- solutions**. You can already make them happy further digitalizing their processes and make them more transparent via dashboards. 

There is so much hype about AI, Machine Learning, NN and so on..but I though that it at least can deliver some real business value. Meanwhile I more and more receive the impression that Data Science absolutely does not earn the reputation is has. Form my perspective the **cost-value ratio is so bad**.   
Lets assume you build sth. like a recommender or a ticket classification. This takes much time and resources to realize &amp; implement.  In the end customers are somewhat more happier or a ticket process is a bit faster, but does this relatively small benefit really legitimate your high labor costs as a Data Scientist?  
I know for large tech companies all this AI-stuff makes sense because with one solution they can reach an incredible amount of potential users. But is **current** Data Science worth it for the average company? From my perspective predictive models are tech overload for most of the companies right now.  Automating manual work with excel are problems that should be solved first.  


What do you think?   
Is your daily work really Data Science?   
Is Data Science worth it regarding real world problems? Or this is field still to young for most companies and will need more time to grow?",datascience,1575710286,Love4Python,1,1,True,2019-12-07

International Business Communication Standards (IBCS),"I  wonder if you ever heard about the International Business Communication  Standards, short IBCS, due to the fact I use them mostly every day.

As  a Data/BI Analyst I always have to report all types of data to all  kinds of people inside the company I work with (which is a german  insurance company). A few years ago I discovered the IBCS and since then  I often apply them to my reports. Unfortunately it is no standard in  the company yet, so I keep informing people about it.

What  the IBCS do is implementing standards for reports (preferably  company-wide but not necessarily) so the way the data is reported is  independent from the person that reports it. You may have seen it in  your company as well, that e.g. a revenue report from one devision  doesn't look the same as the revenue report of another devision. Some  deliver barcharts, some deliver pie-charts, some deliver tables and so  on and so forth. The problem with this is, that the customer (in this  case the management) always has to get into the specifics of every  report and maybe doesn't understand them or come up with false  conclusions. With the IBCS you can minimize this problem.

Some  industries already have a high standardization for good reason. Think  of sheet music. They always look the same, so musicians all over the  world can read them. Engineers have it. Circuit diagrams look the same  all over the world. Architects have it so building plans could be  understanded by everyone familiar with it. Business reports DON'T have  it. Why is that?

Besides of that,  the IBCS give valuable tips for data presentation in general, so the  message you want to deliver is actually delivered and not misinterpreted  because of bad report-design. They use the so called SUCCESS formula  which stands for Say, Unify, Condense, Check, Express, Simplify and  Structure.

If you want to get further information, I recommend the Homepage and the YouTube channel:

1. [https://www.ibcs.com/](https://www.ibcs.com/)
2. [https://www.youtube.com/user/HICHERT](https://www.youtube.com/user/HICHERT)

Unfortunately not all (but some) of the videos are in english, but most of them have english subtitles.

This  one is my favourite and entertaining. It goes about the aspect of  Simplify (unfortunately in german, but I think understandable just by  watching): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhkiMX8zbDE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhkiMX8zbDE)  
The standard-translation-function from YouTube is ok (but not perfect) too. Give it a shot.

The IBCS Standards are available in the version 1.1 for download (PDF) on the website: [https://www.ibcs.com/product/ibcs-standards-pdf/](https://www.ibcs.com/product/ibcs-standards-pdf/)  
You can get a copy for free, if you apply for membership with the IBCS Association (passive membership is for free!).

I  want to mention, that I have no business relationship with them and you  can have all the information for free. They sell a book (which I  haven't read yet) and give courses (not online, I think). I am just very  convinced of the concept and I would like to spread the word. Due to  this I will crosspost this article in the following subreddits:

Data Science bubble does not exist,"Competence in Mathematics, Statistics, Programming, and Data-Visualisation, will be increasingly demanded.

It is like a language unto itself. As people who speak it rapidly increases, and eventually rise to senior decision-making positions, they will only want to hire those who speak the same language.

Companies whose senior leaders cannot speak Data Science, will quickly lose to companies whose leaders are well-versed in sound data-driven decision-making.

Blue-collar and white-collar workers are roughly differentiated by their reading and writing ability. Blue-collar workers often produce far higher value than white-collar glorified pen pushers, but because high-level decision-making and communication is done via English (or whatever lingua franca), those who are less-skilled in English will tend to be lower on the organisational hierarchy.

Similarly, we are witnessing the emergence of a new class of workers who are differentiated by their ability to read (interpret the results of) and write (utilise) mathematical, statistical, and computational methods. Those who speak Data Science will tend to rise to the upper echelons.

Furthermore, expertise in maths, stats, and programming, are easy to assess, and difficult to fake. This means that managers who have gotten by (or even risen to the top) via smooth talk, will find it increasingly impossible to continue their charade. Case study: [When Elon Musk realised China’s richest man is an idiot ( Jack Ma )](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/cy40bc/when_elon_musk_realised_chinas_richest_man_is_an/)

Data Science cannot possibly be a bubble. It is a superior decision-making language / medium whose importance will only skyrocket as more people learn to use it effectively.

(  
Actually, a sort of bubble does exist: the multitude who foolhardily rote-learns “data science in 3 months!!!” without developing true understanding of the underlying statistics, maths, and coding skills, will find themselves utterly ineffective even if they can produce a data science portfolio via “monkey see, monkey do.” Recruiters will simply toss them an aptitude test assessing general maths / stats / coding ability, and such monkeys will quickly be filtered out. (Even those with full degrees will not be spared, if they thought they could get away with skimping on the maths / stats.)

Cf. [https://priceonomics.com/survey-which-data-skills-do-you-need-to-get-ahead/](https://priceonomics.com/survey-which-data-skills-do-you-need-to-get-ahead/)

“ It’s potentially challenging to get 80%+ of executives to agree on anything, but the survey reveals that business leaders think data skills are now a requirement for becoming a senior leader and those skills will only become more valuable over time.”

“ On each question regarding the value of data skills, Chinese business leaders scored highest on emphasizing its importance. Over 90% of respondents in China noted that they need data skills to get promoted and that data literacy was a requirement for entering senior management. Even for general office work, 88% of respondents in China noted that data skills were a requirement. If data skills are table stakes for competing in the global economy in the future, Chinese businesses are foremost in recognizing this education need.”

“ While data science jobs get a lot of publicity as a “hot career,” the reality is data science is not the only data-related career with high growth and demand.

"When you were a new Data Scientist, how quickly did your responsibilities increase and when did it warrant a salary increase?","TLDR: New fresh-grad MSc. in my first job as an Associate Data Scientist. Responsibilities grew to twice that of a normal Senior Data Scientist within 6 months. How can I make the most of my situation, whether it means promotion, increasing compensation, refusing too much work, etc?

Hi guys,

I'm in a bit of precarious situation and I hope you guys would be able to help. I'm a new age Data Scientist (mix of Business Intelligence with ML thrown in often for impact analysis, but not for production). At the beginning of this year, I left academia (previously PhD. Candidate) with an MSc. in civil engineering. I applied and was accepted into a big funded start-up (think Alibaba / SoftBank funded). From the long interview process, I was rated as barely a Senior DS; worried that I couldn't keep up due to my lack of experience, I pushed to become an Associate DS with a salary close to a Senior DS (based on my market analysis), which was accepted.

However, in the span of 6 months, I went from working 1 Associate Product Manager (PM) with 1 product to 2 PMs (1 Lead and 1 Asso.) with 3 products. Now, by end of January, due to reorgs (no layoffs though), I'm now asked to **solely** handle 6 PMs (2 Leads, 1 Senior, and 2 Asso.) with 9 products. According to my company's DS career ladder, I'm qualified to be a Senior DS when I work with 2-3 PMs and 4+ products. However, my manager has already stated that while a promotion is ""on the table"", I likely don't have the work experience nor enough spent in the company to be considered for a promotion yet. Promotions requires multiple level of approval, so it isn't purely based on my manager's discretion.

If a promotion isn't possible anytime soon, is it possible to ask for a salary increase or refuse the increased responsibilities? My responsibilities and projects has increased dramatically in terms of scale, scope, and complexity, let alone dealing with constant stakeholder management and context switching due to the highly varied products. Would talking to the Head of DS department help? I'm familiar with him due to many company outings and drinking parties (we've chatted personally as well).

What would you do in my situation? Let me know if there's a better place to ask for advice. I think this is an appropriate place due to being relatable and maybe a question on many DS's minds, given the constant influx of new talent into the industry.",datascience,1575791343,royalon,49,1,True,2019-12-08

When can you drop features?,"When i first learned about feature selection through some Linear Regression notebooks, i've seen some people drop features purely based on the correlation matrix and how much the feature was correlated with the target label.

After learning some more, it seems that you should never drop features until you've trained some models and decided which one(s) to go with. This is b/c the correlation matrix only shows the linear relationship between the features and labels. So you can only drop features in the beginning if you knew that you were going to be using a linear model. This is not generally the case as you usually wouldn't know which model is the best until you've trained some.

Need career advice: late shift from SAP application programmer to data science,"I am from computer science background and have around 8 years of experience in SAP ABAP development(ABAP is a programming language used by the German company SAP to develop their ERP product). I am interested in data science and want to do a transition in my career. however, I have a few doubts - 

&amp;#x200B;

1. I can see that data science is a combination of multiple different but related subjects. Should I try to learn all or is a data scientist usually expert on only one subject while having working knowledge of the rest?
2. Although my career till now is in a business-facing IT industry, I don't have any work experience in data science. How hard will it be to land a job without relevant experience even if I gain adequate knowledge ?
3. SAP has their own tools in data science, for example predictive analytics and modelling software. It'll be easier for me to learn them since I am in the same industry - but will that help me in the long learn? Will the learning lose value once I am out of this particular field?

Quick notes on applying to entry-level analyst/DS roles,"Hey all

Just wanted to share three quick pointers I think might be valuable as someone who got an entry level analyst role on a data science team at a start-up and is now hiring for one:

1) *Data cleaning, data cleaning, data cleaning*: These are the golden words on the resume. Most companies today are trying to apply ML to really complicated real-world problems, which means messy data. If you talk about experience where you have cleaned messy real-world data in detail, that will put you ahead of other candidates.

2) *Generic Projects*: We all know them: housing price regression, MNIST, the flower one, Twitter sentiment analyses, MovieLens recommendation system, etc. Having done this aren't *bad* necessarily, but to someone with who has been around the block of online machine learning courses, these aren't all that impressive. Filling out your resume with original, even if they are relatively simple, projects and models that incorporate data cleaning is much more attention-grabbing.

3) *Why??*: I don't really mind people who message me on LinkedIn, deduce my work email or go to the effort of writing cover letters but you aren't really doing much for yourself if all you are saying is ""Hey I saw the job, I think I am qualified, can I have the job?"". That is what everyone who is applying is saying, you're just being more annoying about it. If you look into our company, even just regurgitate our mission statement in your cover letter, it at least shows you aren't just spraying and praying. I would be more likely to consider someone less qualified who communicated why they want the job.

"Is my career ""detour"" alright?","So this might be more for ML engineer roles, but this sub is the closest I can think of to post to. And I don't think this would belong in the transitioning megathread, because I have already been in the field .I've also kept some details vague on purpose,but I do live in the US.

So my undergrad covered the CS theoretical fundamentals and I took linear algebra courses and ML courses as electives

After that I took some part time grad school and did some startup work in image processing and ML; this didn't consist of much backend engineering, but mainly testing out/implementing/creating image processing and ML algorithms; I did this for about a year.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 got plenty of recruiters pinging me on linkedin, but the problems I found was that I'm not some expert on

these ""leetcode"" problems and system design problems. Also I have a lack of backend knowledge;this would be especially important for the jobs I was interviewing for; even if I make it past the interview,  I know I would be fumbling in the beginning and I doubt a company who would hire me for an advanced role would hold my hands while I'm figuring this out.

&amp;#x200B;

 I stopped  working for them particular reason, and I did get a software engineering role at one of these Indian IT consulting firms, where they send you around to other companies for whatever software role they need. 

Seems like these IT companies have a bad reputation for being easy to get into and being ""body shops"",though the companies they send you to are often major companies.

I needed the income, so I took the role, and so far I have been put on some backend web dev project role where I'm working with cloud services/deployment, REST API stuff, HTTP,etc. I'm thinking this stuff is some of the stuff I need to be a successful ML engineer, so I'm temporarily satisfied trying to pick these skills up before I switch back to an ML role.

And  of course some self study on leetcode and other backend things such as distributed systems/database related topics/systems design are on my to do list too.

&amp;#x200B;

Now here are my questions.

Does this temporary break from an ML role look strange? I won't forget the basics of ML anytime soon, I already have a decent base in ML theory,but I am worried about the optics of it. And there's the fact that its some consulting body shop that might be negative mark on my profile/resume. 

I'm also worried about linkedin;its was my source of steady interviews for ML roles. Like would recruiters stop pinging me once they see my current role is no longer ML based?Also should I remove any mention of ML from my headline, or keep it there since its within my skillset? Right now my headline was Machine Learning Engineer @previouscompany; I haven't updated it in a while because I haven't been job searching.Would it be weird for it to just say ""Machine Learning Engineer""?

For applicants: types of experience ranked,"I've seen multiple questions that get down to the following question: what type of experience is best? Should i take a class or write a paper? Should I do a side project or focus more on my work projects?

This is my personal ranking - it's not universal by any means - but it should give you a decent idea of what matters most in the eyes of hiring managers in industry (academia and pure research is a different beast).

There are two rankings - a primary ranking based on the results of the work, and a secondary ranking based on the source of the work.

**Primary ranking based on output:**

1. Generated profit/revenue or reduced cost.
2. Led to an organizational change (process, decision making, policy, etc.) without a provable impact.
3. Created a product (website, app, etc.) that can be accessed by a hiring manager.

*Logic behind the primary rankings rankings:*

Generating actual value - profit, revenue, etc. - is very difficult to do regardless of where you want to do it. Whether it's monetizing your own app, or convincing a company that you interned with to purchase differently, etc., it's *very* difficult to get to that stage. And that is because not only do you need a good idea, a good problem, and a good solution, but you also need to work through all the other external forces out there to make value happen. That means you need to influence decision makers, customers, colleagues, leaders, etc. so that what you thought of actually materializes real value.

Short of that, you have work that led to change, but where that change isn't easy to tie to real $ value. This happens often - you build a model that makes it easier for people to do a task. So that saves them time - but does that actually increase their productivity? Well, it depends on what they do with their free time. Maybe they now spend their free time dicking around on reddit. Who knows. However, this is the type of experience that show you can go through all of the stages of getting something to actually get deployed - which is, in a lot of cases, the hardest part of the data science process.

Lastly, you have experience that created a publicly available product. It's unclear whether this product will generate value or not, but at least a tangible product allows others to easily evaluate the quality of your work. It is fundamentally different than just talking about what you did - you can actually *show* others what you did.

Anything below that is going to be looked at as low value experience. That is, if you worked on something that didn't generate value, no one uses, and no one can actually see, it might as well have never happened. *We all have projects of this type -* so it's nothing to be embarrassed about, but you want to make sure that you lead the conversation with the projects which are higher quality experience based on output.

This is also why most hiring managers tend to disregard personal projects - because very few of them actually provide value. And if they don't provide value to someone, they are very difficult to actually evaluate. 

**Secondary ranking based on type of experience:**

1. Work project
2. Research project
3. Capstone project 
4. Personal project 
5. Classroom project

*Logic behind the secondary rankings:*

To me, there are a couple of things that I feel a data scientist needs to be able to do in order to be successful:

1. Work with other people - including some who will be unnecessarily difficult to deal with
2. Get answers to problems even when the answers are ugly
3. Know how to change the answer without changing the question - i.e., learning how to change their approach without abandoning the original intent/problem statement.

Work experience is generally the only type of experience that covers all three. You can't escape organizational red tape, you *have* to get an answer to problems, and you can't just switch the problem statement at your convenience so that you can get a nice answer. Other, higher-up people in the organization can influence how fixed problem statements are, but you cannot unilaterally go change the rules to make your answer pretty.

Research has two gaps: sometimes you can get away with doing research on your own and avoid others, and you often get to choose and frame your research work to be something you can actually solve. Really good research experience (which would be on par with work experience) would be projects where you *have* to work with other people (especially cross-departmental work), and projects where the research statement isn't flexible, e.g., when a funding agency asked for a specific solution and you can't bend that to suit your needs.

Capstone projects can have gaps across the board. A lot of times you work on them alone, you get to decide what you want to do and bend the definition as you see fit to get a cool capstone project out of it, and to get nice, elegant solutions out of it. There are too many moving pieces to ever get caught in a situation where the project you're working on will just require you to power through some really painful, soul crushing stuff.

Personal projects share all of those issues, but to a greater degree. The worst part is that they are 100% optional - you don't even need to do this work, so it's very likely that you will self select only into projects that you know you can solve. I would say there are absolutely good personal projects - but those will be the ones that include ugly, gross steps that no one would normally want to do. Like scraping and cleaning gross data. Or doing a bunch of non-sophisticated data manipulation to cover big gaps in data. 

Classroom projects are the worst because they are like personal projects only that on top of that you get expert opinion for a professor to steer you away from infeasible projects. So again, you will self select into projects that can be solved, and you can likely fudge them as needed to make sure they are solvable.",datascience,1572020773,dfphd,6,18,True,2019-10-25

"Where to find info on how to actually *structure* your data wrangling scripts, not just how individual pandas functions work, or some such thing","I have seen hundreds of blogs addressing pandas ""tricks"" or ""functions you need to know"", but have had less success in figuring out how to structure the code best to avoid errors and to make it obvious how you got the data from point A to point B. Does anyone have any advice on how that should be done? As an example, I typically find myself in the same data wrangling scenario, and despite knowing how to solve the problem with various pandas commands, I'm never sure if the script is laid out in the most readable way.

Let's say you have a long script that has one goal: take multiple tables of data from somewhere clean them, then combine all the data into some output table of interest. Along the way, you  do various operations (merge, drop, rename, map, filter, aggregate, whatever) and you end up with a final csv table.

Common ""programming tips"" tell you to make everything modular (""functions should only do *one* thing"", ""functions should be small"", etc.). The problem is, I'm not convinced that data science lends itself to this practice as well as a large codebase for software development. When getting data from point A (raw) to point B (tidy), depending on the complexity of the operations along the way, I will often come back to the script to find where I've accidentally duplicated something during a merge, or dropped something I wanted to keep, or omitted some important data. It seems that in cases like this, I want to see everything in a line, i.e.
- Merge table 1 and 2 on this column
- Groupby these columns and keep only columns X and Y.
- Use function f on columns X and Y to get column Z.
- Merge table 3 into this table
- etc.

When everything is modularized, it feels like you have to go hunting in a list of tiny functions all defined somewhere below your `main()` to see what all happened along the way. 

The point of all this is, are there some standard practices out there that are *not* for ""programming in python"", but rather for ""wrangling data in python using pretty much only pandas and that's it"" because usually, all I see out there is yet another person telling me the function signature for `DataFrame.groupby` or some such thing we have all read more than we need by this point. On the other hand, if you look at the high-level code organization, you'll get into repo folder structure, with `setup`, `requirements`, `tests` and the like, which is a bit far on the other side of the spectrum (not to say it isn't important, too). But where are the examples of the best way to script wrangling of raw tables A, B, and C into tidy table D, and the way to structure your script to do that? I'm looking for some advice from someone who isn't teaching about ""why pandas is useful"" nor ""how to to keep your software project team organized while developing your 5 million-line code base""

Predict figure skating world championship ranking from season scores,"I just finished a [personal project](https://medium.com/@seismatica/predicting-figure-skating-championship-ranking-from-season-performances-fc704fa7971a?source=friends_link&amp;sk=7e6b2992c6dd5e6e7e1803c574b4236d) whose goal is to predict the world championship ranking from previous scores in the season (for male and female single skaters).

The obvious way to rank skaters is to take their average score of the season and rank them from highest to lowest. However, one potential problem with this approach is that the scores are averaged over different events, and no two events are the same (think different judges, ice conditions, or event altitudes). Therefore, I came up with different ranking models that can somehow tease out the skater effect (how good a skater intrinsically) from the event effect (how does an event affect the score of a skater). The models themselves are essentially just simple linear models, but I'd never thought about using linear regression this way. 
I've also documented how my models perform over the baseline model, which is the average season score model mentioned above.

If you have any feedback or ideas on my project, please don't hesitate to let me know!

PS. I'm in the process of cleaning up the code that I used for the analysis, and will soon add the link to the Github repo in the write-up.

I had asked about linear algebra and I got kind of a little bit of silence on the phone and someone said you don't need to know math at that level. Is it normal for companies to underestimate how much work is actually required to do data science? I mean, the math alone is some serious stuff. From what I could gather, a lot of the program is geared towards learning to write the code in python using existing models, tuning those models, but not really getting deep enough to understand all the math going on in the background.

I just recently graduated this May, and am working as software engineer at a tech company, with some internships under my belt as well.

Advanced probability courses helpful?,"Hello all, 

I am quite curious as to whether or not courses in advanced probability theory may be of help in working as a data science (or even simply in graduate level statistics/data science courses)?

As an undergraduate, I did a degree in Maths focussing on applied maths and statistics, in which I did classes such as Intro Probability, Intro Stats, Measure theoretic probability, stochastic processes, linear and generalised linear models, bayesian stats, diff equations and complex analysis. I also took a couple of comp sci courses such as Algorithm design and Object Oriented programming. 

I’d have to say my favourite classes in my degree were those in probability. I found the stats to be too heavy on the theory that it was actually hard to learn practical implementation. But now I am considering either doing a masters degree in maths (focussing on the same areas as my undergraduate, namely probability and statistics) and masters degree in data science.

For reference, the data science program has a lot of the masters of maths statistics subjects as core, the maths is really emphasised in the course. 

The main reason I don’t want to do the maths degree is because the statistics I do will likely be overly theoretical and not too practical. Also, I’ll have to take compulsory pure/applied math courses alongside it which probably won’t be of benefit.

The main reason I don’t want to do the data science program is because it will be lacking in the probability theory which, I feel, is foundational to statistics. 

So simply put, are graduate courses in measure theoretic probability, random processes (which includes martingales, point processes and general CTMCs), stochastic calculus and others in any way useful for a practicing data scientist? This will likely be the deciding factor in my choice, and I haven’t seen too many data science programs with subjects like these.

This part got me a bit lost, I read about tolls like spark that can pretty much do it but I’m missing the part of how to query the result in realtime alongside old passed sessions..

I'm looking for success/failure stories applying unsupervised document embedding techniques,"Hey everyone! :)

As the title says, I am looking for both success stories and disappointing failures of applications of **modern** unsupervised document embedding techniques on actual problems (as opposed to academic benchmarks, toy datasets, academic evaluation tasks, etc.). The main focus is naturally on industry uses for business/product problems, but I would also love to hear about cases from government bodies, non-profits, use in research (with empirical measurement and where document embedding is one of the tools, not the subject of research) and any other ""real life"" use. I would love to hear about your experience, but connecting me to people you know or even hinting me towards companies or projects you know used these techniques (or tried to) would also be of tremendous help.

What's in it for you? Well, I'm preparing a talk for [the data science track of the CodeteCON #KRK5 conference](https://codetecon.pl/en/#program) based on my [literature review-y blog post on document embedding techniques](https://towardsdatascience.com/document-embedding-techniques-fed3e7a6a25d), and while I feel I have a pretty good overview of the academic papers, benchmarks and SOTA status up until the most recent stuff to come out in the field at this point in time, I can't say the same for uses in the industry; I have a partial view from my experience in one ongoing project to actually use this, and experience shared by some of my data scientist friends (all in Israel, naturally) - most of it, so far, by the way, is that averaging (good) word embeddings is a very tough ""baseline"" to beat.

This is why I thought reaching out to get a better sense of things in the industry world-wide, and enriching my talk with the status of actual successes and industry applications will give people attending my talk more value, and will serve my attempt to make my talk a status report on the topic.

And (coming back to WIIFM) naturally (I think), I intend to share any (share-able) knowledge I accumulate not only in my talk, but also by adding a section dedicated to it to [the aforementioned blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/document-embedding-techniques-fed3e7a6a25d), and maybe even by writing an extended post around it (if enough interesting trends and issues come up). So, hopefully, if you are (like me) interested in this, we might also end up getting, together, a nice overview of where the industry stands at the moment.

What **modern** techniques (so no variants of bag-of-words or topic modeling techniques) am I talking about? These are the ones that I know of (I'd love to hear about others!):

* n-gram embeddings
* Averaging word embeddings (including all variants, e.g. SIF)
* Sent2Vec
* Paragraph vectors (doc2vec)
* Doc2VecC
* Skip-thought vectors
* FastSent
* Quick-thought vectors
* Word Mover’s Embedding (WME)
* Sentence-BERT (SBERT)
* GPT/GPT2 (can also be supervised)
* Universal Sentence Encoder (can also be supervised)
* GenSen (can also be supervised)

"Is it plausible for me to try for a top rated Data Science, CS, or Applied Statistics Masters?","I’m currently a senior at a top 5 business school in the US. I will be completing the course work for both a Finance degree as well as an Management Information Systems (MIS) degree, but since my university doesn’t allow double majoring in the same college, I will probably graduate with a BBA in MIS and minor in Finance. I will also graduate with a certificate in Computer Science (2 classes more than a minor) which is also recognized on my transcript. I never really tried in school until I recently decided I wanted to pursue a masters and now realize I have some catching up to do.

I do not have course work in computer architecture, OS, or Linear Algebra on my transcript but I have self taught myself more of the concepts in these departments by auditing those courses and learning off YouTube and stuff. I have however taken plenty of CS courses that relate to data science and ML and business statistics courses with high grades.

Will probably graduate with a 3.6/4 GPA, and will be working as a Data Science Consultant post graduation. I have done internships in Cybersecurity Analytics and Real Estate Private Equity, both in relatively reputable firms in their fields.

Most of the jobs I really want require a masters so I intend on doing so, but I want to try for the best program I can get into. Assuming I do exceptionally well on the GRE (I am pretty good at standardized testing), what are my chances of getting into good programs and brand name schools such as Ivys or other top 10 Unis?

Question about educational attainment,"I currently work as an analyst in the financial sector, mainly working in research. My background is a masters in econ from a public university (nothing special about it in terms of rank). I was able to do well in my econometrics courses, and I'm lucky to be able to pick up coding fairly easily, which I have done along the way.

I'm in a position where my employer is willing to cover most or all costs of further education, and I would like a second masters degree. I'd like to get something from a respected school to increase my mobility, and I'd like to continue working as an analyst but gain additional skills that are highly in demand (i.e. obvious concepts such as machine learning are becoming more important). My geographic area (Cleveland) is not necessarily ideal, for doing something locally, so an online program may unfortunately be best. 

I know that what will be most useful to me is something in applied math/statistics/computer science (I'm not sure I buy into any value add from the new programs in ""data science"" given my existing econometrics background, but I could certainly be wrong about this).

I am the only data scientist in my company, and although I have a PhD specifically in applying data science in my domain area, I have only been at this company for 3 years.  I have a colleague who has been caught up in the “AI/ML” craze who is a hobbyist programmer. He received permission and has been working this year on interfacing with a certain database and creating a user interface for a ML process optimization tool. I was supposed to help with the “ML” part by helping guide him in how to curate and clean data, generate a model, and implement that model in a sustainable fashion.

Instead, he has created his own version, a Frankenstein-ish ensemble of models that is completely uninterpretable. The data he used is unreliable and ripe with unstated assumptions and human interaction; it is *not* representative of the underlying truth and *cannot* be safely used to predict future performance the minute any changes arising from the current model are applied. Further, the application is such that problems mean explosions, not just loss of revenue. At best, he’s generated a poor model; at worse, a dangerous one.

He’s already demonstrated this tool to management and the VP in charge of the process. He wants to move forward with field trials next month. I found out on Friday. What now?",datascience,1572193860,Katdai2,41,17,True,2019-10-27

Math PhD to doing research in ML,"Hello everyone,

I am currently a Math PhD about to defend in January. I work in a field in functional analysis that uses a lot of measure theory (but no stats).

I have been considering transitioning careers since I don't enjoy my research area anymore. I have enjoyed taking a couple graduate courses in Machine learning/DS at my University and performed well in these.  I have since had the itch to do research in these areas (I have been especially enjoying bandits and reinforcement learning in general due to their deep mathematical roots). All the research related jobs/internships I have looked at so far seem to require either a graduate degree in CS or publications in ML (which I do not have due to being new in this field)

My questions are as follows: Is it realistically possible to find a research position in this field with my background, without a second PhD? Should I just go into applied DS/data engineering in industry instead?

I wanted to know what my practical career options are. I was thinking it would be nice to apply my research background in math to doing research in Data Science, but I realize this would be hard to sell.

Definitions of Overfitting,"Recently came upon a paper (and blog post) that talk about how boosted models don't overfit:  [https://jeremykun.com/2015/09/21/the-boosting-margin-or-why-boosting-doesnt-overfit/](https://jeremykun.com/2015/09/21/the-boosting-margin-or-why-boosting-doesnt-overfit/) 

This made me curious though, because they seem to be using a similar, but different definition of overfitting than I typically use. I'm curious what other people tend to think of overfitting as. The two primary definitions I've seen:

1) A model is overfitting when (during the course of training) the validation error begins to increase while the training error continues to decrease.

2) A model is overfitting when (after training) the validation/test error is much larger than the training error.

Personally, I see the 2nd definition as being more true to what overfitting actually is, and is also the more practical of the two. Overfitting is a tool that can be used to determine how to continue hyperparameter searching in the right direction (for example, introducing regularization if there is high overfitting). Whereas the first definition, seems more like a vanity point.

It seems to me that it is spurious to make a claim like 'boosted models don't overfit' because that would imply that they don't ever need to be regularized in order to achieve the best performance, which seems patently false.",datascience,1572267800,MrTwiggy,58,77,True,2019-10-28

Being a data scientist is easier than the interview process that is in place to land a job as a data scientist at so many companies especially if you apply for jobs in the Bay Area or a big tech hub.,"First off, I’m not implying being a data scientist is easy. You need to have a strong mathematical, analytical, programming, and domain knowledge background. 

But the interview process in place at so many companies especially in the Bay Area or New York City or seattle is comparable to running a marathon. I’m sure it’s challenging elsewhere too but these markets are the worst when it comes to interviews. Well duh who doesn’t want to live in a happening city with lots of tech jobs. 

Why? 

So many companies in these markets give you coding tests where you have to code three questions in one hour, a case study, technical white board interviewing questions, and then meet a panel of people over six hours to prove that you are a perfect fit. 

And this isn’t for a lead engineer or VP of engineering. This is all for a junior data scientist.

Factors/Categoricals in Sklearn with Decision Trees,"Hi everyone,

I'm looking for a solution for what I think is probably a common problem with categorical data in Sklearn. When it comes to model proto-typing, I am typically an R user but have been developing software in Python for about 7 years.

I want to create a single decision tree for a task. The majority of the data are categorical features. The decision tree is going to be used by people rather than a machine, so keeping the depth of the tree limited is important.

In R, we have the factor data type as a way to encode categorical features. When a split in the tree (using the rpart package) is made, it can take multiple factor levels into account for one split. For example, you might see a split being 'Browser = Chrome or IE or Firefox' where we essentially use one split for three levels of the factor.

If we compare that to Sklearn - there is no factor data type. All the suggestions I've seen have been to use one-hot/dummy variables, which is fine... except, the same situation now takes three separate splits -- 'Browser = Chrome', 'Browser = IE', and 'Browser = Firefox'. Given that I need to keep the depth of the tree limited, this feels like an inefficient use of my depth 'budget'.

However, Sklearn provides a more convenient hyperparameter tuning scheme, particularly for decision trees, and most of my colleagues are pretty much entirely Python users exclusively. Is there any other encoding method, package, or workflow that can help me solve this problem with Python/Sklearn? I know pandas has a 'categorical' data type, but IIRC it just maps the levels to a sequential integer, which has its own set of problems.",datascience,1572278779,jaredstufft,14,24,True,2019-10-28

For example once I did not pass because I did not use cross-validation to evaluate the accuracy. Another time because I did not compute the confusion matrix or the feature importance. None of those things were asked in the assignment. 

I think most of those home works evaluate candidates very poorly. They generally only show that you know how to read a csv with pandas and how to do fit/predict with sklearn.  I think they are ok for very junior roles. 

I am considering withdrawing from all the interviews that ask for a data science homework :-)  or maybe to ask to be paid as a contractor for the time I have to spend doing the homework.

Need help with understanding how to run a tensorflow Session,"I've been trying to learn tensor flow for the past couple days and I can't seem to figure the part of the code where you run the session.  i,e . ""With tf.Session() as sess: ....."" etc etc

Basically, I'm following a standard MNIST tutorial I found online, but I'm trying to repurpose it with my own data as that will help me understand it better (and also, i dont work with image data that much, so I'm using a logistic regression type problem (predicting 0's and 1's).

The part of the code that I dont get is this:

            for epoch in range(hm_epochs):
                epoch_loss = 0
                for _ in range(int(mnist.train.num_examples/batch_size)):
                    epoch_x, epoch_y = mnist.train.next_batch(batch_size)
                    _, c = sess.run([optimizer, cost], feed_dict={x: epoch_x, y: epoch_y})
                    epoch_loss += c
    
                print('Epoch', epoch, 'completed out of',hm_epochs,'loss:',epoch_loss)

This is after you set up all your layers, and after you initialize session and the global variables.

I dont understand lines 3 through 5.

what is ""\_"" and what is mnist.train.num\_examples/batch\_size?

what is mnist.train.next\_batch(batch\_size)?  

Basically, if I was using my own data (X\_train, X\_test, Y\_train, \_test, I dont know what to put in place of the ""mnist"" sections.

in the tutorial, I dont think I saw ""mnist.train.num\_examples"" or mnist.train.next\_batch get declared anywhere, so I'm not sure where those came from.  Are these variables or are these methods off of the variables?

What exactly is ‘consumer experience’ data and is it useful?,"I work in sales in a small finance firm and recently our company has invested a lot of money into a data team focusing on consumer experience.

Adding some data skills for career improvement,"Greetings, everyone!  


I´m not very sure if this is the right place to post but I feel that someone might be able to throw some light. 

 I´m a psychologist and I have been working in the HR department of a big company for almost 3 years. I pretty much manage employees data, but lately I have been assigned with more ""data"" related task (reporting, metrics, simple data visualization, some ""analytics""). My boss (after seeing that I have slightly more hard skills than my fellow coworkers) even told me about implementing Power BI to improve our data visualization. 

So, taking in consideration that current trends in the job market (and that I would like to become a more appealing talent for overseas companies in the future) I have decided to take this opportunity and start developing some data skills. The problem is that... there´s so much information and so many paths that I could choose that´s kinda overwhelming. 

After doing some reading, I have narrow down two paths that I, somehow, could use my previous HR experience or knowledge of the business and find interesting: People Analytics and Business Intelligence. Now, the thing is I don´t know where to start or which one should I start developing first or which one could open more job opportunities for me and so on...

If anyone could provide some light to this poor human science soul, I´ll highly appreciate it.

We understand that digital transformation is undergoing exponential growth, and would like to hear from beginners, students and academics to add a breathe of fresh air to the community, or even professionals who are thought leaders in project delivery. This may be in construction, medicine, energy, engineering, life sciences and so on. 

The meet-ups are free with pizza provided! we think they are a great way for students and professionals to build their professional networks with other Universities and members from numerous data science and industry organisations.

In any case, I feel like I don't know enough statistics. All my courses felt so theory based. Prove X Y Z. This is how you derive X from Z, memorize this and prove it in an exam. Use the MGF of this distribution to prove this joint distribution, etc.

To be honest, most of that stuff went over my head. I passed the courses, but it felt more like me memorizing the proofs and writing it down with small manipulations to fit the exam. Regardless, I feel like in the real world I'll be working with data sets, data collection, manipulating it, cleaning it, analyzing it, etc. And I know none of that.

I have a strong background in computer science as well if that matters. So, what should I do? I got around half a year left of school to go and I'm looking for some more courses I can take online to help me out.

Has anyone transitioned to software engineering from data science?,"How'd you do it?


I'm toying with the idea for a few of reasons:


1. The ""data science"" at my company devolved into more analytics than anything else. I've had to continue take courses outside of work to keep the actual data science skills fresh (stats, machine learning, deep learning) but barely get to apply them and it's a real bummer. At this point, I'm sure it'll be pretty hard to get into a ""real"" data science job if I try to transition. Though it seems that data science roles are becoming more product/marketing analytics which isn't too exciting, and I don't think I'm smart enough for the hardcore phd-level research scientist roles


2. I've had a lot of exposure to the data engineering side. ETLs, AWS infra, version control, various APIs, unit testing, pushing things to production, etc. and I find the process of building something from scratch and collaborating with the data engineers really fun


3. I want to be more on the back end and middle of the data spectrum. Pure modeling and analytics is the front-end, and I feel that only very mature companies have the infrastructure set up correctly for data science to be able to unlock its true potential. More job opportunities in the back end/middle for startup and growth stage companies, which i've been liking so far


4. As far as skill combinations go, software engineer + data guy seems like a pretty deadly combo for future success

# Chapter 2: Why Clean Data?

(Excerpt from[ Ultimate Guide To Cleaning Data with Excel and Google Sheets](https://landing.inzata.com/Ultimate-Guide-to-Cleaning-Data-website-cta))

Data cleansing is the process of spotting and correcting inaccurate data. Organizations rely on data for many things, but few actively address data quality. Whether it’s the integrity of customer addresses or ensuring invoice accuracy. Ensuring effective and reliable use of data can increase the intrinsic value of the brand. Business enterprises must assign importance to data quality.

A data driven marketing survey conducted by Tetra data found that 40% of marketers do not use data to its full effect. Managing and ensuring that the data is clean can provide significant business value.

Improving data quality can eliminate problems like expensive processing errors, manual troubleshooting, and incorrect invoices. Data quality is also a way of life because important data like customer information is always changing and evolving.

Business enterprises can achieve a wide range of benefits by cleansing data and managing quality which can lead to lowering operational costs and maximizing profits.

Who are the heroes who allow the organization to seize and enjoy all these benefits? affectionately refer to these poor souls as **PWCD’s**, or **People Who Clean Data**.  These brave people, and hopefully you are reading this because you hope to be one of them, are the noblest. They often get little recognition even though they clean up the messes of hundreds, if not thousands of other people every day. They are the noble janitors of the data world. And I salute them.

# 

# Top 5 Benefits of Data Cleaning

## Improve the Efficiency of Customer Acquisition Activities

Business enterprises can significantly boost their customer acquisition and retention efforts by cleansing their data regularly. With the high throughput of the prospecting and lead process, filtering, cleansing, enriching having accurate data is essential to its effectiveness. Throughout the marketing process, enterprises must ensure that the data is clean, up-to-date and accurate by regularly following data quality routines.

Clean data can also ensure the highest returns on email or postal campaigns as chances of encountering outdated addresses or missed deliveries are very low. Multi-channel customer data can also be managed seamlessly which provides the enterprise with an opportunity to carry out successful marketing campaigns in the future as they would be aware of the methods to effectively reach out to their target audience.

## Improve Decision Making Processes

The cornerstone of effective decision making in a business enterprise is data. According to Sirius Decisions, data in an average B2B organization doubles every 12-18 months and though the data might be clean initially, errors can creep in at any time. In fact, in nearly all businesses where data quality is not managed, data quality decay is constantly at work. Each time new records are added; duplicates may be created. Things happening outside your organization, like customers moving and changing emails and telephone numbers will, over time, degrade data quality.

Yet the majority of enterprises fail to prioritize data quality management, or even acknowledge they have a problem! In fact, many of them don’t even have a record of the last time quality control was performed on their customer’s data. More often than not they merely discard or ignore data they believe to be of poor quality, and make decisions through other means. Here you can see that data quality is a massive barrier toward digital transformation and business intelligence, much less every company’s desire to become more Data Driven.

Accurate information and quality data are essential to decision making. Clean data can support better analytics as well as all-round business intelligence which can facilitate better decision making and execution. In the end, having accurate data can help business enterprises make better decisions which will contribute to the success of the business in the long run.

## Streamline Business Practices

Eradicating duplicate and erroneous data can help business enterprises to streamline business practices and avoid wasteful spending. Data cleansing can also help in determining if particular job descriptions within the enterprise can be changed or if those positions can be integrated somewhere else. If reliable and accurate sales information is available, the performance of a product or a service in the market can be easily assessed.

Data cleansing along with the right analytics can also help the enterprise to identify an opportunity to launch new products or services into the market at the right time. It can highlight various marketing avenues that the enterprises can try. In practically any other business process you can name, decisions are made every day, some large, but many small.

It is this systematic pushing of high-quality information down the chain of command, into the hands of individual contributors that helps them improve decisions made at all levels of the organization. Called Operational Intelligence, it is used more commonly for quick lookups and to inform the thousands of decisions that are made every day inside the organization.

## Increase Productivity

Having a clean and properly maintained enterprise dataset can help organizations ensure that the employees are making the best use of their time and resources. It can also prevent the staff of the enterprise from contacting customers with out-of-date information or create invalid vendor files in the system by conveniently helping them to work with clean records thereby maximizing the staff’s efficiency and productivity. High quality data helps reduce the risk of fraud, ensuring the staff has access to accurate vendor or customer data when payments or refunds are initiated.

## Increase Revenue

Business enterprises that work on improving the consistency and increasing the accuracy of their data can drastically improve their response rates which results in increased revenue. Clean data can help business enterprises to significantly reduce the number of returned mails. If there are any time sensitive information or promotions that the enterprise wants to convey to their customers directly, accurate information can help in reaching the customers conveniently and quickly.

Duplicate data is another aspect which can be effectively eradicated by data cleansing. According to Sirius Decisions, the financial impact of duplicate data is directly proportional to the time that it remains in the database.

Duplicate data can significantly drain the enterprise’s resources as they will have to spend twice as much on a single customer. For example, if multiple mails are sent to the same customer, they might get annoyed and might completely lose interest in the enterprise’s products and services.

"Company culture rarely changes - the reason behind it, and maybe a way to change it","I've worked several jobs in my life, and one of the things that I have heard discussed, pitched, sold, bought at every one of them was their idea of a company culture.

""We're a company focused on innovation and teamwork"".

""We are a team that is committed to going above and beyond""

Companies, teams and people will self-assign core values and philosophies as easily as they put on clothes, and there is a general feeling that if you say it enough times, that becomes your culture.

But it isn't, and the very definition of company culture - the real definition - is the same reason why company culture rarely changes.

**The real company culture is the set of behaviors that get people hired and promoted\***

It's that simple. If you declare yourself an ""innovative culture"", but you promote the people who are most willing to defend the old way of doing things... you're not. If you declare yourself of being a high performing culture, but the people that work themselves to death get passed for promotions by the people who play politics, then you're just a political culture. If you declare yourself to be a company that believes in family values, but has VPs that demand their employees to work nights and weekends to meet deadlines... you get the point.

Most importantly, because the people that exhibit these behaviors get hired and promoted faster than the people who don't, your organization will always put its future in the hands of the people who live that culture - the real culture. And that means that it will be *incredibly* rare for someone to be in a position of authority that is willing - let alone able - to challenge that culture. And that is because, by definition, what got them there *is* the culture.

*Why are you posting this?*

Because my current role is one of the few I've had where I have felt happy with the culture, and what it made me realize is that at several of my previous stops I subconsciously was waiting for the culture to change. In some cases, it was their viewpoints on work-life balance. At other stops, it was their commitment to data literacy. 

And those things never changed, and even after I have left and looked back several years later, they haven't changed. And this includes organizations that have had changes at the C-Suite level - several of them. 

**If you are not happy with your company's culture today, you need to start looking for a new job yesterday, because you are on a ride that will make you more and more frustrated each day until you explode.**

And you don't need to do that to yourself. There are too many jobs out there, too many companies to subject yourself to a company culture that doesn't jive with you. More importantly, there are 100% companies out there with healthy cultures that can foster a good career for data scientists, regardless of what your personal preferences as far as work-life balance and everything else might be.

*Ok* u/dfphd*, you mentioned something in the title something about changing company culture. How do you do that?*

Note - this only works in a subset of cases: 

1. Live the values the company wants you to live when everyone outside your team is watching (i.e., get all your work done the way the company wants it done when people are looking)
2. In private, conduct yourself (and your team if you have one) according to the values that you think the company should value *and deliver outstanding results while doing so.* 

You have a company that doesn't value innovation, but rather producing the same 1000 reports every day? Well, keep producing the same 1000 reports every day, but then in ninja mode, come up with an alternate solution that does away with the 1000 reports. And then implement it, and make everything better, and have a bunch of people give it glowing support. 

And then do it again and again and again and again until you start infecting people around you and they want to get some of that same positive feedback you're getting.

Caveats:

1. It works a hell of a lot better if you're an executive. Or at least like an upper-middle manager (e.g., Director).
2. It is *exhausting* both for you and anyone who you may manage.
3. If you ever slip up on your primary work, you will get crucified for spending any level of effort on this other stuff, so you need to be flawless.
4. Even if you do everything right, it may not work.

Multi-variable Calculus,"Hey all,

I recently converted over from a domain expert to a data scientist in the same industry and am starting to plan out what I should learn in my spare time. The goal is to learn things that will hopefully be useful in the near future, but will also make sure that I have the foundation I need to have a long career in ds.

Never got around to taking multi-variable calc in college. Its been years since I took Calc I and II. I want to understand deep learning/optimization better, so knowing this material seems important. Any recommendations for resources of sufficient depth? Should I spend the time retaking the first two or would my time be better spent somewhere else (focus on comp sci or stats, etc.)?

My question is this: do you think I am expected to figure out a ""work-around"" and fill in any observations that are left blank due to NA values after filling the blank column?

NEED SMART PEOPLE AND A.I. TO SOLVE A MAJOR PROBLEM IN MY COUNTRY,"I apologize in advance if this isn't the right subreddit for queries like this. But I know that you are just the right audience to help us tackle this issue.

So, here it is:

We have a problem and we need ideas from smart people to help us tackle this. So if you all could spare a few minutes and think about this one, you could save LIVES.

I am working with the hardworking and important people government in my country in Southeast Asia.

So, in my city we used to have a with a lot of crime. Terrorism.

So to prevent it, we installed these 'checkposts' on several roads. They were like blocks to make cars go through, slowly, so the police could examine them closely and stop anyone if they seemed suspicious.

The checkposts looked like this: [https://www.samaa.tv/wp-content/uploads/digital\_news/2011-12-20/police-night-check-posts-in-islamabad-9739.jpg](https://www.samaa.tv/wp-content/uploads/digital_news/2011-12-20/police-night-check-posts-in-islamabad-9739.jpg)

We also did major cleanup operations against terror organizations and gangs and terrorism dropped so much. There's barely any terrorism here anymore.

So, we don't feel the need for extensive checkposts anymore.

And the we are getting rid of the checkposts and we want to replace it with technology.

So if any of you have any good ideas as to how that could be done, then that would be much appreciated.

If you could engineer a solution, own an AI company or know someone who knows an AI company or know anyone that could help, we'd love to work with you.

Remember: We need a replacement for checkposts so keep that in mind. The checkposts had a few policemen. They were there at night as well. So we need, through technology, pairs of eyes that can look at night. We also need some way to distinguish between suspicious cars. So it should have a way to check for explosives. Perhaps, radiation?

I was thinking a whole network of cameras equipped with Artifiical Intelligence and Machine Learning, that can also monitor all the spectra of light coming out of cars, to see what was in the car and check for explosives, and all the cameras across the region communicate with each other and log in every face through facial recognition and every car and number plate they see.

But, I'm still unsure about my idea.

That's where I need smart people like you to pitch in their ideas. Remember, this is for the security of ordinary people and your good idea could save lives, so every idea is valued.

**GOAL: Teach people how to analyze data and help companies gain insights from the data we collect**

**Week 0 “What is Data Analytics?” (short 30 min talk just gauging people’s interest)**

* Value of data to companies, talk about good/bad data collection policies
* Who is Data Analytics for, why bother, etc
* Get people to actually sign up and see when they want to have classes (after main meeting, on weekends, etc)
* Send out dev environment setup to people interested (simple script to install python and libraries if you have time, maybe create github to hold lesson plans and have people pull from there)

**Week 1 “Introduction to Data Analytics and python”**
 
* First real workshop, have everyone get familiar with Google analytics and Python (with jupyter notebook!)
* Talk about tools such as Google Analytics, Tableau, Looker
* Insights and examples from certain cases
* Real world cases where DA has helped businesses grow and find weakpoints
* Explain rest of course curriculum and timeline, have everyone build their own DA projects with provided datasets (homework!! (keep it light though))
* Provide external resources outside the class

**Week 2 “Data is messy”**

* After everyone gets familiar with python, teach them how to use numpy and pandas to clean and wrangle data
* Try to keep it interesting, don’t bore people with just like “okay this is how you use a numpy array”
* Maybe run a crash course through important stuff to know with linear algebra and python (matricies, etc)
* Give people homework to clean up a provided dataset for next workshop

**Week 3 “What does it all mean?”**

* Hopefully everyone did their HW, if not provide finished hw to work with
* Show how bundles of meaningless data can actually be transformed into insights related to business decisions
* Show how to create meaningful reports with the data provided with Pandas and Jupyter Notebook
* Incorporate usage of these skills with customers

the total sample size I got was 42, isn't this value too low?And since there are 3 groups, does this mean I need at least 42/3= 14 participants in each group?

Imposter syndrome for a beginner,"Hello everyone,

Is it common to feel the ""imposter syndrome"" when one begins their path in data science?

I dived into this field because I indeed felt I have a great interest in playing around with data. My previous job was on the fence of data analysis, though I worked majorly on Excel with e-commerce data. With this work, I felt I wanna grow in this field and that is what made me to apply for a post-graduate degree in Data Science.

However, after joining the course, I feel I don't understand much. The scatter plots and graphs make me go blank. The ML algos are way too confusing. I am giving in my best efforts, but I am doubtful whether I really belong here.

Do most people feel the same in the beginning? Please share your experience. I am really in need of some motivation to get out of this supposed imposter syndrome.

Question on how to handle financial data over time,"Good morning,

I am working with a data set that incorporates financial information overtime. Here is an example of a similar, simplified data set:



Year | # Guests | Money Spent (total) | Money Spent (avg per guest)
---|---|---|----
1960| 10| $100 | $10
1961| 10| $110 | $11
1962| 12| $140 | $11.67
... | ... | ...| ...
2018 | 200 | $6500 | $32.50
2019 | 210 | $7000 | $33.33

My question is do I need to account for inflation? For example, according to the [US Inflation Calculator](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/), $100 in 1960 = $867.43. Would a more accurate representation of the data be something like this?

Year | # Guests | Money Spent (total) | Money Spent (avg per guest)
---|---|---|----
1960| 10| $867.43 | $86.74
1961| 10| $944.60 | $94.46
1962| 12| $1190.27 | $99.19
... | ... | ...| ...
2018 | 200 | $6649.30 | $33.23
2019 | 210 | $7000 | $33.33

What do you think is the most accurate way to handle this sort of data? Present it as raw data as it was collected? Or incorporate inflation?",datascience,1572873065,HobbesForPrez,6,2,True,2019-11-04
Data scientist looking for a change,"Cross post from r/cscareerquestions

Background:

I have been a data scientist for about 2 years now. I have a bachelors degree in Economics. I started out doing risk modeling for an insurance company. About 5 months ago, I was hired by a small consulting company. My role here is more of a machine learning engineer. I create machine learning systems to automate business processes. I am proficient in Python, SQL, and R.

&amp;#x200B;

Current Job Issues:

Machine learning is a hard field to do consulting work in. Most companies that have adequate data infrastructure already have a data science team. Those that don't have the appropriate infrastructure can't benefit from machine learning. As a result, I am getting little experience in my current role. So, I'm looking for a change. For every project I have, there are \~4 weeks of no work. Doing this time, I get certs and do research. Right now, I only have UIPath certification.

&amp;#x200B;

General concerns about the field of Data Science:

I live in a medium sized city on the east coast --  not a ton of data science jobs. Additionally, I don't enjoy the modeling aspects of the job nearly as much as the engineering. I understand most commonly used models, when to use them, their pitfalls, etc; however, my interest with them is very applied. I don't have any desire to develop new machine learning algorithms -- only using pre-existing tools to add business value.

I would like to use machine learning as one of many tools to automate business processes.

&amp;#x200B;

Future Steps:

I'm thinking about leaving Machine Learning specific roles in favor of a Software developer role, but I don't know if I could close to my current pay $75k. I can take a slight pay cut, but not too significant.

&amp;#x200B;

Questions:

Could I get a decent job as a Python Software Developer with my current experience?

Should I just try to get a machine learning engineer at a different company?

Any other input?

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr

I like the engineering side of machine learning the most. In a dead end job. What should my next step be?",datascience,1572878469,azzipog,17,7,True,2019-11-04

Business Undergrad to Fortune 500 Data Scientist Role,"Hey r/datascience- with the mods permission/encouragement I thought I would try to give back by doing a write-up of my road from an undergraduate degree at a business school to a Fortune 500 Data Scientist role on a R&amp;D team. 

TLDR; I spent a couple hours everyday for 2 years learning and doing analysis for fun, and found opportunities for data science in every aspect of my job until I had enough experience for someone to take a chance on me and hire me

My starting point:

Degree- BBA from a top 50 school in Information Systems and Data Analytics

Relevant Coursework- Intro to Statistics, Database Design, Intro to SQL, Applied Business Intelligence Tools (Alteryx, Qlik, Tableau), Intro to Data Visualization, Intro to Machine Learning in SAS, Web Application Development (Javascript/HTML), Intro to Mobile App Development (Swift)

With these skills I was able to land a job as an analyst at a global consulting firm (i.e. Accenture/CapGemini, EY)

**Below is a roadmap of my first 2 years at my first job**:

First project on the job:
- Gathering requirements for a BI application
- Here I spent 4 hours everyday 7 days a week taking courses on Data Camp and reading books like Python for Dummies. I it took about 8 months to replace all of my excel work with Python and really learn enough to be useful on a team of business folks. 

With the skills from my first role I got a new project doing data cleansing, data munging, quality checks etc. using my existing SQL skills and new skills in Python. I was asked to do all this work in excel, but forced myself to do everything in Python both to learn and prove myself worthy of harder tasks.

I took opportunities to do simple statistical testing in Python and when I saw opportunities to bolster my team's analysis by looking at things such as feature importance from a tree based model or setting up data correctly for a simple linear regression, **I forced that work into our project by doing it on my own time and presenting it to my team**.  

Slowly I became my team's go to general analytics and Python automation person. I used this internal reputation to get a new project on a team looking to implement some basic ML models at a client and needed someone who knew sklearn and could guide client analysts in doing things like walk-forward validation for time series models, and pointing out issues such as data leakage. 

On my own time I started to read books like ""Forecasting, Principles and Practice"" by Rob Hydnman and find dummy datasets on Kaggle to test concepts on. I took things a step further by creating dashboards of analysis I did for fun and putting together a small Tableau/Github portfolio, and adding a Personal Projects section to my resume. The portfolio work I kept private and would link it either in cold emails to hiring managers, or keep it handy in case I discussed a pet project during an interview. 

**Finding a new job**

Job titles I was searching for- Data Analyst, Associate Data Scientist

Number of cold applications over 3 months- ~60

Number of first round phone interviews- 7

Number of final rounds- 3

Job offers- 2

Almost every interview process followed this format:
- Phone screen with recruiter to discuss background
- Take home technical exam, either SQL or Python, just general analysis
- Phone call with hiring manager
- On site technical + meeting with hiring manager and team 

My pitch was that I was able to tie business problems to data science solutions, and could not only execute on problems as a data scientist using my technical skills but also present the results to the business and executives. I think this combination of soft and hard skills was the reason anyone even bothered to talk to me given my background.

I think what got me the final offers was how I presented myself as willing to learn, giving evidence in the form of my pet projects, all of the books I've read and courses I took in my free time. After I received the offer, the head of the R&amp;D group (a math PHD) said he liked my hustle and thought he could just teach me what I didn't know or point me to the right learning resources. 

For those of you looking to break in, I definitely think even if you're not someone with the perfect background, with enough time and study you can do it. 

My next step as I move into this role will be applying to masters programs to shore up all of my quantitative deficiencies. There's only so much you can learn on the job IMO unless you're really good at teaching yourself mathematical concepts. Unfortunately I learn much better in a class setting with homework assignments and structured learning!

- quite easy to use as I don't have to worry too much about infrastructure
- however it seems that a some of their algorithms are proprietary (even though I am sure that 99% of their code base is coming from open source!!!), meaning it seems I can use them only with sagemaker.

"Worth of online ""Professional Data Scientist Certificates"" as an upper year CS Major","WARNING: I can be unintentionally long winded when describing personal situations, TL;DR at the bottom.

Hey all,

I'm a 4th year honors Computer Science major at a Canadian university. Hopefully on track to graduate on time, but due to a nasty motorcycle accident in October my current semester has gotten pretty buggered up and may not be able to pass all my courses this semester, which is leaving me incredibly depressed.

After my undergrad I have always planned to pursue a career in data science. I'm quite proficient in R and it's machine learning libraries, moderately well versed in Tensorflow, proficient in Python, currently writing my honors thesis on 3d model reconstruction and 3d texture segmentation using ML (mainly Open3D).

It is what I am passionate about and I have a decent functional background in the field already through university courses specific to Data Mining and Artificial Intelligence and projects on my own through hackathons, Kaggle competitions, etc, although I will be the first to admit that I have much to learn.

The ""Professional Certificate in Data Science"" I see waved around is so incredibly tempting to me, however. I have a very strong applied (vs computation theory) CS and statistics background, and the idea of taking that knowledge and hammering out one of these say, Harvard offered programs, and then using that to launch into a career instead of taking another semester to grind out miscellaneous electives and some abstract theoretical courses is oh so tempting. But is there even any value to these courses? 

TL;DR: Currently a 4th year CS major with data science background and it is what I want to pursue as a career. Would having a ""Professional Certificate of Data Science"" from Harvard Online be of any value career hunting, over say a generic CS degree?",datascience,1572974618,Shade450,2,1,True,2019-11-05

Reaching out to local Recreational Marijuana Dispensary in an effort to increase sales... how should I speak to convince them?,"A local marijuana dispensary has a very shoddy website which barely operates.

All the product packaging has information about the company, terpenes content percentage, and its lineage. 

The possibilities are endless. I'm not exactly sure how I would begin to implement this and when I could see good results.

Would anyone be interested in using our product for a small amount of money? In return, we're looking for some feedback and suggestions on how we could make it better for a data scientist. 

The product lets the user create live charts that can be embedded, shared and updated. Here's a link [bigcrunch.io](https://bigcrunch.io)",datascience,1573090603,otterquestions,4,3,True,2019-11-06
What laptop would you recommend I buy?,"I am thinking of buying the Surface Pro laptop, Samsung 9 Notebook Laptop, Dell XPS 13, Lenovo Yoga 920 (or Lenovo Yoga 730). 

I am looking for a laptop that is light to carry, can easily process large data and code in R, and will not break easily if it were to fall (I sometimes tend to be clumsy with laptops, where I accidentally drop them and either the screen cracks or the part that binds the screen and keyboard gets broken.)

My original laptop was a Lenovo laptop which I really liked but it was way too heavy to carry around and my shoulders hurt when I carried it in my bag which is why I am trying to buy a new laptop otherwise I would have bought the same exact model. As of right now, I am borrowing a MacBook Air laptop but I do not like it much, I miss using a Windows laptop.

I asked already in Best Buy online and they said that the Surface Pro would be good buy for me but I would like to know if it is worth it or would you say a Lenovo or Samsung 9 Notebook is better. Please help me with this because Thanksgiving is coming soon and I would like to purchase my laptop (most likely online) around this time.

[R] Announcing the release of StellarGraph version 0.8.1 open-source Python Machine Learning Library for graphs,"StellarGraph is an open-source library implementing a variety of state-of-the-art graph machine learning algorithms. The project is delivered as part of CSIRO’s Data61.

We are happy to announce the 0.8.1 release of the library, which extends StellarGraph capability by adding new algorithms and demos, enhancing interpretability via saliency maps for Graph Attention (GAT), and further simplifying graph machine learning workflows through standardised model APIs and arguments. 

This release, we’ve dealt with some bugs from the previous release and  introduced new features and enhancements. Some of these include:

* New directed GraphSAGE algorithm (a generalisation of GraphSAGE to directed graphs)
* New Attri2vec algorithm  
* New PPNP and APPNP algorithms 
* New Graph Attention (GAT) saliency maps for interpreting node classification with Graph Attention Networks
* Added directed SampledBFS walks on directed graphs
* Unified API of GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE, and HinSAGE classes by adding build() method to GCN and GAT classes
* Enhanced unsupervised GraphSage speed up via multithreading
* Support of sparse generators in the GCN saliency map implementation.
* Unified activations and regularisation for GraphSAGE, HinSAGE, GCN and GAT
* Changed from using keras to tensorflow.keras

We’ve also added [new demos](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph/tree/master/demos/) using real-world datasets to show how StellarGraph can solve these tasks.

Access the StellarGraph project and explore the new features on [GitHub](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph). StellarGraph is a Python 3 library.

We welcome your feedback and contributions.

With thanks, the StellarGraph team.",datascience,1573093198,StellarGraphLibrary,1,1,True,2019-11-06
Nurse Switching Careers,"I am a fairly new nurse working in the Operating Room. I have also worked in other areas of the hospital not as a nurse and determined its not going to get better.

Advice on longitudinal data,"I have some longitudinal data taken at roughly (but not exactly) regular intervals, maybe about 5 time points per object. The problem is that there is quite a bit of data missing not at random as well. 

You can think of it as a bunch of sensor readings or measurements taken e. g. around the middle of every month in a 6 month period. 

I'm wondering if anyone can suggest methods I can use to leverage the time dependencies besides treating each of the sensor readings as independent features or augmenting the features using their sum/difference/statistics etc? 

Are there any models that can be applied to this kind of data and how do you typically handle the misalignment in time (I'm less comfortable with interpolation/binning due to the low number of time samples) 

I'm sure this problem pops up a lot of the time in clinical settings as well.

Not sure what to do next? (Line between Data Science and web development?),"Found lots of really useful advice on this sub so I thought I’d give it a whirl myself.

For context I have a masters degree in Neuroscience, about halfway through my course I was introduced to bioinformatics and data science and haven’t looked back. Competed a thesis on classifying Alzheimer’s from blood proteins and lipids in blood samples and learned R and Python. Fast forward 12 months, working for a SaaS company in digital health, have learned SQL, power BI and Tableau. Also learned HTML, CSS and the concepts of HTTPS. Most of this comes from self teaching myself some computer science and machine learning concepts. and being curious about how data is stored, transferred, accessed etc.  The devs in my company are very open and regularly let me look at work they are doing and talk me through parts of it. I even built a very small reporting website that cycles through the power BI iFrames of different reports in Angular with the help of some team members and really enjoyed it!

We are currently running a large ML project, that I’m loving ,but I have found it very difficult to focus on what I should be learning next. I have really come to enjoy some concepts of web development and see potential to create and deploy web applications with ML models in frameworks like Django, but feel like I might be stretching myself very thin by dipping my toe into lots of different areas when I should just focus on developing my core data science skills?

Awesome experiences as a data scientist on Upwork,"Hey Reddit! I wanted to get feedback on this before I put it somewhere with my name on it. :) What are your thoughts? 

I am a data scientist at a bigger internet company. I work full-time and get good money. At night, when my wife and kids are in bed, I get my laptop and work as a data science consultant on Upwork. I love what I do, and since my day job pays all my bills, I could do it for free. In this article, I explain why I do it and why I would recommend you to do the same.  

## Why am I working for free? And why on Upwork?  

I always wanted to do my own thing, to be my own man. On the other hand, I have a well-settled life and when becoming a freelancer or entrepreneur, there is a risk that I don't want to take lightly. Instead of giving up all the security, I agreed with my employer to moonlight as a data science consultant.  

Cracking the ""find well-paying customers"" is not easy. The options that I knew, that would give me reasonable success were expensive. And especially, since I don't want to do it full time. I don't want to spend hundreds of Euros on Google Adwords to get a customer, that I don't want to charge. On websites like Upwork, you pay shares of what you earn. If you plan on not earning money, this seems to be a good deal.  

In the beginning, my main motivation was to get experience and reputation. Ideally, on the side and from home. The problems that we are facing in my day job are different from the ones that normal people have. And I wanted to know what these were. I was looking for small tasks that are generating a lot of value for the customers.  

What I learnt is that you meet amazing people on Upwork. It's the place where people come, that want to build a product in their most early stage. If you don't have money and you want an MVP, you will be trying to outsource it to the cheapest hire on the internet.  

## The German young graduates whose startup skyrocketed  

One of the **founders of a food delivery startup** reached out to me when their product was nothing but a Shopify website. They were planning on optimising their food buying process and posed me the problem: Given the data that we have, how many dishes we would sell in three days? I did the most simple ""model"" you could think of: a one-dimensional curve-fit. And it reduced their food waste by 20%. At least, that's what they told me at the time. By now, they are worth multiple millions.  

## The mysterious traffic pattern on a Myanmarese flight comparison website  

The **CEO of a Myanmarese flight comparison website** contacted me and asked for an analysis of website traffic data. It was different from my usual tasks because instead of a dataset, I got access to his Google Analytics account. I was asked to explain a sudden jump in traffic that did all seem to come from a single device type. Then, I forwarded him to an expert in website crawling.  

## The guy who uses Instagram ads to price your product before you have it  

Imagine you want to know the value of your product, but you don't have it yet. The way to go about this is to test it. You offer some early version of it or a promise of future access to your product. Then, you show your offer to different people at different prices. I met an **English entrepreneur**, who offered these kinds of analyses in a product. And he asked me to help him to set up a process for testing for significant differences.

## The airport KPI analysis  

This doesn't quite fall into the category ""awesome people with an awesome product"", but it was one of the most confusing experiences. There was this person who asked me to run an analysis on KPIs of an airport. I don't know who he was, why he had the data, or even why he paid me for it. But it was fun!


## Go meet people!

I have met extremely interesting people on Upwork, from different nationalities and different fields, but always passionate about their product. And I have seen that with just a couple of hours of work per job, I can create amazing value for many customers. In return, I got invaluable experiences.  

I would highly recommend anyone looking for work in the data science field to start here. There are so many people ranting about Upwork because of the international competition and price pressure. But if you are looking to grow your data science skills, or you are curious to get connected with startups and their founders, then I would highly recommend to check out these kinds of freelance websites.",datascience,1573155078,mct2011,17,1,True,2019-11-07

"My experience of 6 data science interviews in the Netherlands (mainly Amsterdam/Utrecht) last spring, along with salary + interview questions","Months and months ago I was looking for a new job (and also fresh out of my masters) and wasn't quite sure on what to pick. I only did a few applications and most of them were to companies 2+ hours away. At the time I was planning to move regardless and the Utrecht/Amsterdam Area intrigued me. Here's my list, I hope this helps others. I included salary negotiation stuff, but bear in mind the payouts are meager compared to the US. All monetary amounts are in gross euros per month. I'm also keen to hear feedback.

I posted this before on r/cscareerquestionsEU.

Me: 4 internships (2.5ish years) + 1 year of experience as a software engineer/scientific programmer. BSc and MSc in CS.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Company 1: Small Data Science consulting firm.**  
I was referred by a friend. The interview was about 1 hour, with a consultant and an engineer. I got along great with the consultant, but not so much with the engineer who seemed hostile and did not read my resume - he started asking me questions about my current manager while I made it very clear I was currently finishing up my thesis (and didn't actually have one). They were growing out of their office, and simply couldn't afford anyone who could not directly be put on contracting. I did not get an offer. Questions they asked:
   * Why did you change majors?
   * What kind of projects have you done?
   * Would you be willing to move into a data engineering role? (I said preferably not - shame on me)
   * What kind of management style do you prefer?
* **Company 2: Big Insurance / Bank**.   
I connected well to both the recruiter and their main engineer. The PhD engineer was working from several hours away and was doing a lot of data engineering and devopsy engineering stuff and he basically needed a partner because he was the only engineer for their data science team. This was somewhat of a misrepresentation from the advert. Regardless it went well and they asked me for a salary indication- I asked for 3000/m. They felt this was too much and they were also not able to cover my train expenses (300-400 / month) to get to the office. The very nice recruiter mentioned they would have to offer it to the engineer too, who was travelling each day by his own means. I wasn't ready to drop my expectations for transport / salary so the decision to not move on was mutual.
   * What kind of side projects have you done and are you working on (I showed them a side project for 5 mins)
* **Company 3: Big Data Science Consulting firm.**  
They immediately made it clear I could work for them but the offer was rather low (2650) however they have a very good lease deal and if I didn't like a car they also offered it as a flat pay-out, which would bump up that number to 3300 /month gross. I would be part of their data science team and could work for clients all over Europe so by far this would be the most interesting to start off my career. However, outside the car they had no scheme for public transport so I'd have to pay that out of my own pocket. I eventually received a second offer from them which was slightly higher, which I took.
   * What kind of models have you worked on in school?
   * What kind of work have you done for your last internship?
   * What are your expectations of consulting?
* **Company 4: Small Data Science consulting firm (direct competitor to #1).**  
This remains the weirdest interview I have ever had. I was referred by two friends who independently also provided feedback and what my salary expectations should be (these kind of friends are nice). It turned out this company was actually two different companies, with a smaller one offering traineeships and a bigger one offering consulting services. The interviewer (also CEO of the traineeship) was blunt and hostile, and mentioned several times ""You should know this"", ""You listed your master on your profile and we've had others from the same university come by who knew it fine"",""I am only going to evaluate you for our traineeship because you don't have the skills to work as a consultant"", and ended with ""You don't have enough motivation to come and work here"". There were no coding or implementation-based questions. The interviewer was a guy coming from economics (I recall?) and had gained his DS knowledge from online course material. I left the building with a bit of a depressed feeling but also wondering wtf just happened. Questions:
   * Why does Logistic Regression work well on NLP problems? (I explained, and then he said XGBoost was better and to use that instead - lol?)
   * How does backprop work?
   * How do SVMs work (once I started explaining I was interrupted and they said the question was too easy)
   * How do ANNs work
   * How do CNNs work
   * How does gradient boosting work
   * How come you never finished your first bachelor?
   * Do you regret switching majors?
   * How many credits did you get in your first ever year at university (Honestly I couldn't recall, I gave them an estimate and said I didn't think this was relevant to the position)
* **Company 5: Large online retailer**  
I was referred by a friend and had a phone interview. That went fine and they gave me a salary indication afterwards: 3500/m. I then had to do a couple of IQ-style tests which took a couple of hours. Additionally, I had to work with a data set they provided and build a PoC or demonstrate my findings. I spent about 12 hours on this data science take-home test and really liked it. I went wild with lambda's.Finally I was invited to go on to their main office for four rounds of interviews. **I was so excited that I didn't manage to sleep that night** so you can imagine how that went.. for the first 2 rounds I passed my HR and engineering interview, but the last interview with two managers went worse. I still think I was pretty close to being let in and for about a week or so deliberated asking for another chance. 
* **Company 6: Big Consulting Firm (competitor of #3).**  
I was referred by a friend who invited me over for coffee first. **Within 24 hours** a recruiter called me back and offered me a position as a Business Intelligence engineer, said they had a hiring freeze for their data science team but that they really liked my profile and were able to match #3 in salary (which was a joke anyway). I declined the offer.

In all I have had mixed results. Small consulting firms are picky. Larger consulting firms are greedy. Glad I chose the company I did back in Spring, but the salary could be higher.",datascience,1573165164,Captain_Flashheart,108,1,True,2019-11-07

Text analysis advice,"Hi, everyone.

I apologize if this is the wrong community for my question, but I feel like it's too general for Stack Overflow etc.

I have a bunch of texts of interviews all of which mention the topic I care about, but also cover other irrelevant topics. The goal is to use sentiment analysis to determine if the interviewee spoke about the relevant topic in a positive/negative way. So, if I leave the irrelevant chunks in, it will most likley bias my results.

Question: are there better ways to remove the irrelevant parts than simply cutting off everything before the first mention and everything after the last mention of the relevant topic?

Data science bootcamp help,"So after a few times failing to apply for data science/data analytics jobs, i started to think maybe i need to go to bootcamps, since most employer in my country would just really look for bootcamp certifications from someone. I took some edX class on computer science with python (but couldn’t get to finish it and didnt get the certificate) and am now learning via Datacamp, as one of my friend suggested me so I can build my portfolio (I don’t have one currently). Although, I’m still far from finishing the Data Science with Python track. 
There’s this bootcamp I’m interested in that has 2 classes of data science with python (which has the lower prices since money is tight), the introductory and intermediate. I’m hesitant on joining the intro class since I’m already familiar with python, and their modules are only going to include basic logics, functions, modules, and packages. The intermediate class will learn about deep learning, optimal algorithms, classic conversion networks, neutral style transfer, and other more advanced stuff. 
So, my questions are:
1. Should I take the intermediate class, and are the things being thought there needed in data science career? I figure if I take this class, I’ll keep learning the basic stuff from Datacamp. 
2. Since I’m only going for the certification, is the intro class already adequate?

[R] Accurate and interpretable modelling of conditional distributions (predicting densities) by decomposing joint distribution into mixed moments,"I am developing methodology e.g. for very accurate modeling of joint distribution by decomposing in basis of orthonormal polynomials - where coefficients have similar interpretation as (mixed) moments, e.g. to model their relations, time evolution for nonstationary time series.

We can nicely see growing likelihood of such predictions as conditional distributions when adding information from succeeding variables.

While people are used to predicting values, which can be put into excel table, we can get better predictions by modelling entire (conditional) probability distributions - starting with additionally getting variance evaluating uncertainty of such predicted value e.g. as expected value.

I have implementation and further develop this methodology - what kind of data could you suggest to use it for?

Workflow progress document to integrate Data Science and Consultancy efforts,"TL;DR: What is the best approach to keep an interactive document with the progress of a data science project? A Word / LibreOffice Writer turned fillable PDF? Webpage form? Other?

A ML model that solves a problem no business needs is useless, therefore good communication between client-consultancy-data scientist is necessary.

Working as a Data Scientist in a small startup, I want to streamline the communication between us and the consultancy team. The consultancy team interacts with different companies to understand their business needs and come-up with a data-driven product or insights. We as data scientist need to give feedback of what would be a plausible solution and develop those if the project continues.

I want to keep a document per data science project that tracks the business insights the consultancy team gained (client's KPIs, problem statements, etc) and where the data specifics are written down (labels available, file formats, etc). Basically a central document that keeps track of the project's development accessible by both us and consultancy (less technically skilled).

The workflow document would be filled in progressively as the projects moves on. Roughly my idea is to have sections like:

* Stuff that consultancy has to ask the client (data labels etc) and their business problem.
* Data Science considers which (proxy) variables a ML model could be trained for and what constraints the model would have.
* Consultancy determines if such (a) model(s) would give enough business value at what True Positive, FP, TN, FN rates and whether the client can live with the model constraints.
* Checklist before moving to deployment
* ?

I want this document to be easy to fill-in and standardized (not freely written text). Ideas I have:

1. The most straightforward solution I could think of is to add fillable fields / selectable boxes to a Word document and turn it into a PDF (requires paid Adobe PDF for the fillable fields) / LibreOffice (free and powerful, but kinda ugly: [https://www.linuxuprising.com/2019/02/how-to-create-fillable-pdf-forms-with.html](https://www.linuxuprising.com/2019/02/how-to-create-fillable-pdf-forms-with.html))

* \+ Easy to edit for non-technical people
* \- Hard to trigger some code (necessary?) / document automatically updated by code
* \- Easy to have multiple copies of the same file if people download, edit, but not upload again

2. Webpage that is designed to be printer-friendly. Could host on some internet connected server / cloud?

* \+ A lot of flexibility in styling
* \+ Data can be automatically stored in a database
* \+ Editable from a browser
* \- More technical skill needed. Cannot be edited by consultancy and few resources online how to create a form that can be converted in a .pdf.
* \- More time consuming

&amp;#x200B;

1. Any advice on what is the best way to have a shared progress document with both consultancy and data scientist as audience?
2. Any recommendations on what to include in such status document?

My idea for steps required to automated diagnosis to become a reality,"**tl;dr:** see [this](https://i.imgur.com/fDLDWeO.png) badly made diagram


Steps:


* automate data gathering about someones health, so its cheap and fast enough for most people to do all of it periodically(like once a month), or at least most of it, bloodwork, scans, diseases already diagnosed, current treatments, etc, in specialized clinics built for this purpose of data gathering.

This is the crucial step, if this is done, the rest will come more or less naturally. For this to be done, serious improvements in exam/tests automation are required, the less human work, the cheaper and faster, the better.

* everyone will slowly, increase their personal dataset with their health data
* all of those personal datasets will feed into a huge botnet central database with all the personal datasets
* this central database will be free and shared among researchers, obviously the data will be anonymized(things like person name, SSN etc will be removed) so the hit on privacy won't be as huge

This will serve two purposes:

1) The central dataset will be used by researchers using big data technology to generate PROPER science and understanding of the human body and diseases, with data-based models that actually predict disease behaviors with respectable accuracy. Current medicine models are pathetic, vague and hand wavy, because of lack of enough data to be analyzed.

2) Using the insights and knowledge generated, those can be applied into the individual datasets, it would be possible to create end-user software that detects diseases and predicts future ones, then present treatments options or lifestyle choices in a user-friendly way, an obvious example: ""your chloresterol is a little high, that can turn into coronary heart disease in X years, please consider Y lifestyle changes and/or Z medication treatment""
This is an obvious example that most already know, but with the extensive coverage of the insights gained, a lot more obscure 

Then doctors will be a lot less necessary, mostly for niche cases or giving the greenlight on the recommended actions by the software, until full blown software autonomy is viable.

But again, the cheap full health data gathering is crucial, when this will be a reality nobody knows.

Also, if theres already some research or material expanding on this idea, I would love to take a look.",datascience,1573248498,jim1564,10,1,True,2019-11-08

I've come across the field of data-related careers as data interest me a lot. I'd love to do stuff with it in some way, but I'm not overly interested in some of the possible math and stats. As a school student, math is one of the things that comes easier to me, so it shouldn't be an issue for me.  

However, what turns me off a bit is the buzz-word, hot-stuff, marketing BS that comes with machine learning. You may feel free to convince me otherwise, but I'm wondering if there are careers in data out there where you will get to do mostly technology oriented programming(rather than stuff like ML models, mathematics oriented), and actually more of ""handling"" the data.

"More CS/programming/tech oriented data careers, rather than math/stats?","Hey all,

I've come across the field of data-related careers as data interest me a lot. I'd love to do stuff with it in some way, but I'm not overly interested in some of the possible math and stats. As a school student, math is one of the things that comes easier to me, so it shouldn't be an issue for me.

You may feel free to convince me otherwise, but I'm wondering if there are careers in data out there where you will get to do mostly technology oriented programming(rather than stuff like ML models, mathematics oriented), and actually more of ""handling"" the data.

Need help transitioning,"I have a Bachelors in Political Science and a Masters in Political Economy and have been interning as a research assistant for a few months. I want to transition into Data Analysis due to interest and also because I believe it'll complement my theory-heavy education.  


Some things to consider:  
1. Both my degrees were primarily qualitative in nature. I took introductory courses in Maths, Stats, and Computing during my undergrad; but didn't acquire any serious quantitative skill.  
2. Learning new skills does not intimidate me. I am a self-taught graphic designer and also pay a couple of musical instruments.  
3. I had a strong command over Maths and Stats before pursuing a Political Science major but lost touch over time.  


Any and all suggestions are highly appreciated:  
1. If you think self-education is a viable option; what should be my route?  
2. If you think I need a degree (or other formal qualification), what would you suggest?  
3. Can I utilise my qualitative skills and theoretical nuance in order to secure an entry-level job? If yes, what is the minimum I need to learn in order to get my foot in the door?

The Pharmaceutical Industry &amp; How It’s Taking Advantage Of Big Data,"The pharmaceutical industry is a field that has proven ripe for the use of data analytics. It’s an industry that has interests in getting more information from:

* Research and development
* Clinical trials
* Quality control
* Marketing
* Patient outcomes
* Regulatory concerns
* Manufacturing processes
* Inventory

Although there are strong concerns about personal privacy and regulatory compliance, the pool of anonymized data available for analysis is one of the deepest of any field out there. Both predictive and prescriptive analysis methods provide an array of tools for organizations to use. Let’s take a look at some of the basics you should know about data analytics in the pharmaceutical industry.

## The What

Analytic platforms are computing systems designed to derive insights from large datasets. Most companies in the pharmaceutical industry have access to data about drugs, groups of patients, trial participants and sales. This means analytics work in the industry is extremely diverse, with research going into things like:

* Discovering new drugs
* Studying potential drug interactions
* Planning for regulatory responses
* Preparing for future market conditions
* Anticipating epidemiological trends

The analysis performed is grounded in statistical methods that are well-known throughout the scientific and business communities. Unlike many other industries, pharma is well-positioned because many of its professionals are familiar with key concepts like:

* Chi-square analysis
* Hypothesis testing
* Scientific controls
* Regression testing

To the extent that some professionals need to develop their skills, it is usually in understanding [machine learning](https://www.inzata.com/bi-encyclopedia/machine-learning/), [artificial intelligence](https://www.inzata.com/bi-encyclopedia/artificial-intelligence/), programming and [database](https://www.inzata.com/bi-encyclopedia/database/) management. Most folks in the industry, though, have the necessary backgrounds to contribute to analytics work or to quickly get up to speed.

## The Why

It’s difficult to overstate just how many ways pharmaceutical companies can benefit from analytics initiatives. Consider the case of bringing a drug to market. Using [machine learning](https://www.inzata.com/bi-encyclopedia/machine-learning/) to study chemical interactions can speed discovery by allowing researchers to examine millions of hypotheses at once. When simulations flag potential solutions, a company can then greenlight practical testing. Statistical methods can be employed to sort through data from clinical trials, too. If a drug proves its efficacy, the company can even use analytics to measure the potential market, identify regulatory hurdles and coordinate the filing of patents to maximize the time the product will be under control.

## The How

Computing power is essential. Data analytics in any field are dependent on large-scale [storage](https://www.inzata.com/bi-encyclopedia/storage/) and processing, but that is a much bigger issue in pharmaceuticals. Testing the number of potential chemical combinations when working with two compounds, for example, is demanding from a computing standpoint. Expand that to creating reasonable models of in vivo interactions, and you get some idea of just how massive the processing requirements are.

Similarly, [database](https://www.inzata.com/bi-encyclopedia/database/) [storage](https://www.inzata.com/bi-encyclopedia/storage/) and security are both major requirements. The amount of data that a project will require to get from start to finish can measure into the petabytes. Identifiable information about patients and trial participants has to be secured, and it also needs to be anonymized when put to use.

Companies stand to benefit from improvements in efficiency and processes. They also can produce new work products, turning research and anonymous datasets into products that universities, other organizations and even governments are willing to pay for. Not only can pharmaceutical companies save money through analytics, but they also can discover new profit centers and get drugs to market sooner.

Advice on not getting overwhelmed in a new job?,"Sorry if this is a bit long, but I'm really overwhelmed at work and need desperate advice. Some backstory: I just graduated this past spring with my degree in Mathematical Physics. All of my research in school was in the application of machine learning to problems in physics. I'm mostly self taught when it comes to programming though, as I haven't taken any computer science classes beyond the intro courses, but I've worked on several government funded projects in the area. Most of my experience is writing procedural code for computational purposes in python though, but I do also have experience in C++ and some other languages, just never in a research setting. 

Anyways, I just started a research position this past week that has to do with a lot of the quantum information theory that I worked on in college, but it also entails a TON of software development. My boss knew coming in that my experience was more in the data science realm of things, but the guy that I replaced was definitely a computer scientist who had pretty good software design experience. The most expansive code base that I've worked with up until this point was maybe 5 or 6 files across a folder or 2 in GitHub, but now I'm working on a 4 year old repo that's probably 200+ files and is filled with C++ files, python files, files to bind the two languages, etc. and they're also mostly interfaces which confuse me. My boss is definitely expecting a bit of a learning curve for me, but I have to become familiar with this code before I can start actually working on the stuff that I'm good at. After a week, I'm just feeling like I'm going nowhere fast and I've tried to bring it up to my boss without seeming like I'm totally incompetent. So my first question is does anybody have any tips on how to effectively parse through a large repo that you're new to?

Sociology Major and Mathematics &amp; Econ minor in academic dilemma,"I'm a junior majoring in Sociology and double minoring in Math &amp; Econ. I had been very undecided in what I wanted to study, but after taking a data analysis course in sophomore year I realized that I really like the process of understanding implications in data. Only then I started taking math courseworks and have currently completed a minor in Mathematics.

My current dilemma is that I am torn about whether to stretch myself and do a double major in Math. Initially I wanted to change my major to Mathematics but things got complicated for a number of reasons (i.e. starting major requirement late, couldn't take mandatory research seminar on time, study away issues). My school is known to have rather 'excessive' requirements for majors in general and thesis completion is also required for graduation. Now at junior fall I am faced with the dilemma of what pathway I should follow. I think my main concern is that I'm afraid my Sociology degree does not give the academic rigor in terms of mathematics/stat knowledge (especially in resume screening when applying to larger companies), plus I just find myself enjoying the statistics and econ courses more than my major. At the same time it's a little too late to discard my sociology major entirely.

Should I just bite the bullet to take requirements that are not in my interest (ex. Abstract Algebra) to complete a second major in Mathematics, or just take more useful electives in programming/statistics and focus on other projects, internships and solid thesis (in line of computational social science, whatever that may be)? Senior year will be stressful with so many other things, and I'm really not sure if overloading every semester will be worth it. At this point I am regretting not having explored Econ major option earlier on, since it seems to complement my interests much better.

I have yet to have proper 'data analysis'-related internships or work experience (just started an RA position on voting analysis in R, have to see how that works), and so really need solid advice on what's actually valued and sought after in real work. I apologize that my thoughts are rather jumbled up, but would appreciate some input. Thank you!",datascience,1573552882,bullcrow98,1,1,True,2019-11-12

Clustering sequences (with repitition and order) for similarity analysis," 

I have a 3D space with points as features of possible words. These points are clustered on the basis of their meaning. So BMW, Rolls-Royce, Jaguar are in a single cluster called Cars. I have other clusters of different vehicles like Aeroplane, Boats, Companies and Person. Let's assume 3 patterns as :

1. Person\_1 -&gt; Car\_5 -&gt; Boat\_9 -&gt; Aeroplane\_2 -&gt; Company\_12
2. Person\_2 -&gt; Car\_7 -&gt; Boat\_9 -&gt; Company\_12-&gt; Aeroplane\_2
3. Person\_3 -&gt; Company\_12 -&gt; Plane\_6

The links represent the order of owning and the numbers represent a point in the cluster as:

1. Car\_5 = BMW in cluster Cars
2. Car\_7 = Rolls Royce in cluster Cars
3. Company\_12 = ANiceCompany in cluster Company
4. Plane\_2 = SomJetXYZ in cluster Aeroplane
5. Plane\_6 = AnotherJETXYZ in cluster Aeroplane
6. Person\_1 = WillSmith (just an example) in cluster people

and so on.

Every point is a 3d coordinate as :

1. Car\_5 = \[1.34562 , 2.54723, 0.34512\]
2. Car\_7 = \[1.45623 , 2.84562, 0.28995\]

I constructed this dataset out of my own interest to find the similarity between multiple paths so I can just cluster these paths based on their similarity and analyse what thing they buy first and why and so on. The order of owning assets and repetition of assets are important for the clustering. The condition of similarity is completely based on the order of things owned. Every point can be considered as a feature for every path.

Things I tried:

1. Forming very complete path into a polygon and finding the centroid of it but even the slightest modification causes 2 dissimilar polygons to have the same centroid thus resulting in wrong clustering.
2. Finding the area between the curves made by sequences. The smaller the area the more similar.

How can I cluster these sequences of points? My goal is to 

1. Cluster the existing sequences/paths
2. For new sequences find the most similar sequence and allocate it in the proper cluster. 
3. The number of clusters is not known from the start as the possible paths are already huge.

I am confused so as to what needs to be done here. Am I missing something?

1. Is there any resource that mentions such kind of problems? 
2. Would Sequence embedding work here? if so what can be used as an important factor to every point to embed?
3. Can anyone direct me to a sequence embedding resource which is more or less similar to this?
4. Would there be any non-machine learning solution?  


An image of the feature points is attached to this post.

[Question] Logistic Regression to predict probabilities,"I've been doing kaggle for about two months with my first entry being Logistic Regression to solve the titanic with ""OK"" accuracy.

This time I am trying to predict the probability that the ferry is late based on: time-series (by the minute) of traffic, the Trip endpoints, the vessel name, the day of the week, time of departure and our target: Delayed (0 or 1).

I am using a logistic regression and am worried about a few things, namely overfitting and having too many categorical dummies as my predictors.

For example my X consists of : 

1. All the dummies for [Trip Endpoints, Vessel Name, Day]. This results in a dataframe with 39 additional binary value columns.
2. A moving average of traffic for the departure time. 

Now as the post title implies, the competition requires me to predict the **probability** of a delay. I did a bit of general research last night that led me to the roc_aux_score and an ROC graph as a good benchmark for my model. 

My score began at .58 with solely my traffic SMA and I worked it up to .69 using all the above predictors. Now my question is can I use ROC score as a relevant metric? I am trying to predict probabilities here, not a binary outcome, which leaves me wondering how I can know what is a False Positive or False Negative? My second question is: if so few categorical fields return so many dummy columns, is using all of them unwise even if my roc score increases?",datascience,1569376823,Ceedeekee,5,2,True,2019-09-24

How do I become a Data Scientist?," Data science is one of the hottest fields in Information technology in the present scenario.

* A career in data science requires a thorough understanding of mathematics and statistics. At the heart of data science is machine learning, analytics, and statistical skills to draw meaningful insights.
* Some of the most commonly asked for skills in data scientist in 2019 are — **R, Python, Hadoop, Apache Spark, Scala, machine learning among others.** Data scientists are also skilled in the knowledge of different data mining techniques such as regression, clustering, decision trees and support vector machines.
* At its heart, data science is the art of analyzing petabytes and terabytes of data in a short span of time and extracting useful information from huge volumes of data. Over the years, data scientists have successfully created new fields of knowledge such as predictive analytics which is used extensively in manufacturing, retail, and healthcare and helps in streamlining operations and bringing down costs significantly.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/2mbm0uhc5oo31.png

**Some of the prerequisites in a data scientist** are — machine learning, backed by statistics, data analysis and in programming languages we have R and Python followed in SQL. So if you have a background in statistics and engineering, you are off to a wonderful start. However, you must brush up your machine learning skills because as a data scientist, you would be working primarily with ML libraries and data visualization libraries. Simply put, the job of the data scientist is to work on the analysis and modeling of data.

**However, besides technical skills, deep industry knowledge and problem-solving skills are definitely a must have.** You cannot find insights in real-life datasets if you are not asking the right questions. Finding patterns and insights is dependent on variables which are assigned by a data scientist. Data scientists are meant to resolve business problems by addressing the right problem that will yield the most value to enterprises.

**Some steps can be followed to take the road to data science:**

* The first step is to get good at statistics, if possible take up a crash course in statistics.
* While an advanced degree in computer science is usually preferred, it is not a must. Get hands on knowledge of programming skills in R, Scala and Python
* Learn Visualization tools such as Tableau, Microsoft Power BI
* Understanding of Hadoop and Apache Spark is a must
* Learn the fundamentals of machine learning algorithms
* Learn the important tools of the trade – R programming, Python, SPSS, Apache Spark, SQL.",datascience,1569386304,NikitaOchani,1,1,True,2019-09-25

What is the Question that data science tries to answer?,"Hi all,

Been following the sub on and off for about a year now after having caught the general DS-bug that has been spreading in the academia and the industry.  I consider myself as an enthusiastic observer of data science rather than even a hobbyist, as my main academic focus is in economics.

Therefore, naturally, my critique comes from a social science viewpoint. What is the problem that you, as a data scientist, are trying to solve? 

The bandwagon effect does't seem to disappear anywhere from the schoolyard, it just masks itself better in the workplace. And this shouldn't come as news to you that these days everyone wants to do machine learning and neural networks. So just like in the schoolyard, suddenly everyone's in in the latest fad, but half of those only because everyone else is too and the new Air Maxes bought them a second in the spotlight during recess. The equivalent of this in the field of data science shouldn't need elaboration, but I dare to say that the ones in the back of the wagon are the most dangerous ones; as they themselves don't have a strong view of the bigger picture, they lend their skills to the agendas of those who do.

There's a paradigm in political economy, that the more things are (attempted to be) quantified to guide decision making, the more fascist the system becomes. Quantified Self is already a thing. Quantified Others is also a thing, as the Cambridge Analytica/Facebook/Trump campaign mess showed (facebook has on average 5000 data points on every american citizen - need I even mention this in this sub?). I worked in economics research for a while and my supervising professor had a paper where they applied machine learning (talk about the bandwagon effect) to figure out whether heart rate can predict economic decision making. 

So if you're concerned with predicting human behaviour in your daily DS tasks (as many of you are), what's the consequence? Knowing what people are likely to do is certainly valuable in a profit-maximising economy, but what about on a societal level? Should the government predict who benefits most from monetary incentives to attend university, based on family factors and other columns of data they have? It'd certainly make the invested money yield the most, so why not? 

To go back to the paradigm I presented earlier, the more we rely on this kind of quantified advice, the less the individual has room for movement and the more has been already decided for them. What if we found a gene that would be a strong predictor of impulsiveness and had that gene information of every citizen? We'd be fools for not taking this into account in health care policy and web shop algorithms, right? That companies probably already know the citizens better than the governments is troublesome because the companies are driven by profit, not by moral considerations (be it equality, wellbeing or individual freedom). 

I don't want to get into discussion about what if the models have bias and the siloing-up of worldviews following recommender algorithms. They are obvious problems that the field faces, but are secondary to moral considerations I present here.

I may appear as a warmongerer to some and seem to having omitted all the real opportunities the new science provides. I'm NOT saying there is no place for data science - I'd just like to hear from within the field what that place is perceived to be.",datascience,1569404874,boatwatcher,5,0,True,2019-09-25

- Algorithms and Data Structures (to pass those leetcode style coding tests which are increasingly becoming commonplace)
- Python and R (if you can leetcode comfortably, then you’re already at a pretty advanced level)
- SQL (you must know your groupbys, joins, subqueries, CTEs and window functions by heart and apply them appropriately)
- NoSQL (syntax is similar to SQL but you must know the key differences and usecases) 
- Apache Spark (depends on the company)
- Some experience in cloud: AWS Redshift, Google BugQuery, Azure CosmosDB (preferably all)
- Git (self explanatory)
- DevOps (increasingly Data Scientists need to be able to do their own testing and automation apparently)

Hi all,

Long time dweller, first time poster on this sub. I recently graduated with an M.S. in applied statistics (undergrad B.S. in stats) and got hired at the company I interned/worked part time at the past two years while I finished up undergrad and grad school.

The position is pretty nice, and my role is basically being ""the"" analytics guy for a department within the company, so imagine building A LOT of dashboards/helping managers see how their business is doing and make decisions based on that. I already know that this job is going to require a pretty firm knowledge of SQL and relational databases, and using tools like tablaeu as well (not a lot of cool data science stuff...yet). 

I'm definitely going to try and incorporate tools like Shiny R when I begin full time, but I was wondering if anyone on this sub had advice on how to really hit the ground running with my first full time job? I'm already anticipating staying late at the office learning SQL basics and working my chops with python and R (I did a good amount of programming with these in grad school, but it definitely isn't as intensive as a full time job will be).

Any resources you swear by? Any particular books/websites/online courses to take? Any tips on automating reports since we seem to be in the ""Excel Workbook/VBA"" stage in terms of our analytics?

Basically how do I become the best data analyst I can be so I can take care of more ""minor"" tasks that take an experienced data scientist 5 minutes instead of 5 hours so I can start focusing on the more challenging and interesting stuff?

I guess my question is, does the first course include everything I would need to know for data science? Or is the second course sufficient? I don't want to start off with the Python&amp;R course if it's already going to be taught in the Data Science Course. Any pointers/suggestions from seasoned data scientists would be greatly appreciated.

How to learn Data Science &amp; ML,"Hi,

Does anyone have suggestions for roadmaps, steps, &amp; specific resources for learning data science? I want to learn pragmatically, if possible so I can apply what I've learned and potentially get a job down the road. I've heard, ""just do Kaggle"", but I think a wealth of knowledge is assumed, to be on there doing projects.I don't believe I am at that point, unless there's some simple tutorial I missed. 

I think a big challenge for me is finding focused and structured learning (as one would find thru a bachelor's degree). I want to learn, but I'm not to familiar with the order in which to learn, what resources are solid/trustworthy, what order to learn them in, and which particular skills are relevant for getting jobs in the field.

My Background (relevant to this):
BS in Comp Sci
BS in Math
Know basic python (with some pandas/numpy)

Checklist for passing DS take-home assignments,"Hi yall, I wrote an article yesterday about how to pass data science take-home assignments. You can [read it here](https://towardsdatascience.com/passing-the-dreaded-data-science-take-home-assignment-8ae5d55f256b) but the main points are:

* Ask upfront for expectations and future feedback
* Ask questions and state assumptions
* Put in the baseline for modeling
   * Data cleaning
   * Minimal feature selection
   * Impute missing values
   * Create a classification pipeline
   * Try training with a couple of sci-kit learn classifiers
   * Tune hyperparameters with grid-search
* Make your code readable
* Write Tests and Comments
* Summarize your thought process in under 500 words!

Also, make sure the company is not offering a technical screen as an alternative! I've found that it is literally **job discrimination and illegal** for a company to offer take-home assignments to some candidates and technical screens to others for the same job.

How to transition into data science career advice?," Hi,

I am currently a ""data analyst"" working in a small finance operation, it is my first job out from university and I have been here a little over 2 years.

This is in the UK if that matters.

In that time I have developed my skills a bit and would say I know enough excel, SQL, PowerBI/Tableau to do my role effectively.

I am interested in the future in moving more into ""data science"" and as such have recently (&lt; 6 months) been working with Python, I would say whilst I am not close to being an expert I have a decent handle on it now and am at a stage where even if I don't know how to do something I can probably figure it out given some time.

For instance I have automated some very long processes within the business regarding data manipulation which is savings soooo many hours.

I have used a fair amount of pandas, numpy and have seen a small amount of scikit/tensorflow/keras (this is what I am very interested in and have built a neural network to recognise digits 0-9 \[typical tutorial example I know!\]).

I have also been exposing myself to jupyter notebooks and trying to learn some different ml algorithms (regression, KNN, SVM's etc).

I like the fact that I can use some of the more advanced mathematics that I studied whilst at university.

The problem I am facing now is two things:

1. Is it possible for me to transition over into ""data science"" with only a BSc in mathematics?

I did achieve very high marks (&gt;90% avg overall) so I think that shows that I had the ability to carry on further to a masters/phd level but ultimately I chose not to (besides I did mainly study pure mathematics towards the end of my degree with less statistics so I'm not sure how much further education would have helped, I guess more linear algebra maybe?!?! I don' think I would have been looking at machine learning etc.). I feel this could be a massive drawback as I am not qualified for a data scientist role and I wondered if this will hold me back, ideally I would have a ""junior"" type role where I could learn a lot on the job.

2. How do I go about achieving this?

Any advice from perhaps someone who has been in a similar position would be fantastic.

So what do you guys/girls think?

PS: When I say data science, I am referring more to roles that would involve a whole team of people solving problems/ making recommendations using advanced techniques in machine learning (tensorflow, scikit-learn etc).

Of course I have no formal experience in this area and appreciate the terms are used all the time and mean different things depending on who you ask and has largely become a buzzword so please correct me if you feel I am wrong.",datascience,1569440130,easycub,1,1,True,2019-09-25

The Secret sauce to landing a data science role,"I see tons of posts on here claiming specific technical skills needed to become a data scientist. As someone who conducts interviews, mentors new data scientists, and up-skills analysts and engineers, I wanted to offer my perspective. While I believe it is true that there are certain base technical skills required, I do not believe technical knowledge is what your interviewer is looking for. 

The skills listed are merely talking points. Your interviewer most likely understands that you aren't currently an expert at every skill they question. They are likely interviewing you until they get to skills you are unfamiliar with. How do you respond when you don't know something? Do you admit it, or do you try and cover your competency? Are you defensive or are you curious? This is a continuous learning and feedback role. How have you identified, learned, and implemented a new skill? Are you even passionate about learning?

They are looking for you to be confident in what you do and do not know. Do you boast algorithms and techniques you can't explain or worse, are you arrogant or elitist? Quickly in this role you will be presented with extremely ambiguous requirements. How comfortable are you with this ambiguity and how can you adapt or learn what is necessary to overcome and move forward with development? Will the team risk failure because you didn't speak up about your ability? Do you seek perfection and risk analysis paralysis, or do you iterate and experiment quickly? Are you someone who is a joy to mentor, support, and watch grow? Grit, growth oriented, self-aware, and open-minded are qualities I consider essential. 

With the right mindset and support, the technical skills are not difficult to learn, especially with the pace of evolving tools. It's an investment the company should be knowingly willing too make. This mindset is what is hard to train for. 

Hope my advice helps. Good luck!",datascience,1569448067,mathmagician9,62,495,True,2019-09-25
Help Please: Unsure How to Search for Scientific Articles / Case Studies about Attrition in Upselling in Retail,"I'm not sure if this is something that has been heavily researched, but I'll state my use case in hopes that someone might know where to point me / how to ""word"" the search.

Data Science in 10 Days," 

## Day One :  

Download StackExchange data : [https://archive.org/details/stackexchange](https://archive.org/details/stackexchange) .

You will need an RDBMS to handle the data, so the first day would look like this:

1- Install and configure MySQL. Import the dump into the database then read SQL basics. Spend some time doing simple exercises to get the hang of manipulating the data. Write a script that pulls, for example, set of questions about Python and SQL that have &gt;3 answers and the best answer is written by someone who has &gt;= 10 chose answers in either of those two topics. Observe performance issues.

2- Read about indexes in SQL. Hashing, sorting etc. Speed up the query from the bullet 2 so that it run instantaneously then write a class in Python that handles the queries for you. This will require you to learn about Python MySQL driver. As a result you need a tool that pulls required data from your database and presents it in a convenient format.

PS: I don't know about your background, but I think it's totally doable even for a beginner, all you need is some general experience with Python. (The code I provided in DayOne.py is just working on Windows. If you want to do it on OSX, you'll have to modify line 22 and line 47 to be MacOS paths.) After the first 2 steps, you will need to get familiar with reading data using pandas and manipulating numerical data with numpy. The documentation is quite voluminous, you don't need to read all of it, just be comfortable with importing CSV files, extracting and adding columns, merging two datasets and that's it.

&amp;#x200B;

\-------

 

## Day Two :

While on the actual job you will often run queries on the whole database, it's important to get the gist of how to work with small data and still get meaningful results. Play around with pulling random subsamples and compare the distributions of, say, scores, with the ground truth - the distribution of all scores. Let's move further. You have a whole SE database in front of you, but stick to StackOverflow since it contains a lot of data. One exercise off the top of my head - build a timeline of languages popularity.

## Why is it so cool?

* How do you extract the questions about the languages and omit the ones related only to technology? (for example asking about Python syntax and not about how to mate Django with MongoDB).
* Lots of tags there, you need to visualize the results, so filter your sources wisely.
* You get to learn at least one visualization framework.
* Lots of cool pics.

Of course, once you did that example, there are many more interesting properties of your data that you should explore. Asking the right questions is a key ability.

You can see [https://github.com/benfred/github-analysis](https://github.com/benfred/github-analysis) .

&amp;#x200B;

\---------

&amp;#x200B;

 

## Day Three :

Data Scientist was named ""The sexiest job of 21st century"". You know what else is sexy? Graph theory.

How are the tags connected? Is it possible to build a technology map using just StackOverflow answers? What metrics would you choose to calculate the proximity of two tags? How would you visualize the graph? Have you tried Gephi?

Once you are done, the graph needs to be described. Thing is, the picture of a graph has poor value in terms of comprehensibility - you need to stare and stare at it before you know for sure what's going on.

So, you will need to learn about clustering algorithms (at least k-means and DBSCAN), K nearest neighbors. If you go full von Neumann on this task, some graph metrics and algorithms won't hurt. I suggest you try networkx and some parts of scikit-learn for this, they make everything much easier.

## Why is it so cool?

* You learn about different formats of data. CSV, Gephi, list of edges, etc..
* K-means is very useful algorithm that will serve you well in the future !!
* Discovering the meaningful groups is one of the most important tasks when you explore the data.

Distribute the workload as you prefer, I'd spend the first day tinkering with networkx and Gephi just because graphs, you know then I'd give to clustering, because there are going to be some non-trivial things like ""how the hell do I get vector representations for each tag that would preserve the distances between them?!""

&amp;#x200B;

\-----------

 

## Day Four:

OK, now you have general understanding of what's going on in your database. But you haven't touched the texts yet - word counts don't count .

So, today you need to read briefly about text analysis. For this step good ol' Latent Semantic Indexing would be enough, everything you need you will find in scikit-learn, also you will need to work with SQL. General pipeline you want to see:

* Select the data you will work with.
* Build text features with special extractors in scikit (TF-IDF Vectorizer is the best).
* Assign the labels for the text. Let's say for example that you want to predict how many point will the answer get based only on the text. So, you take a score as a label and the feature vector is TF-IDF.

It would be better to prepare several datasets in the numpy format, one for every hypothesis. I will give you a couple just to get you started:

* Predict the score of the answer.
* Classify the main topic of the answer (choose, say, 20 languages and sample answers about them).

Be sure that your datasets are clean and you know what's inside. This description might seem easy, it's not.

Is there a minimum IQ needed for data science?,"Hi,

I'm currently a freshman majoring in CS + Stat who is really interested in the field of data science.  
DS absolutely amazes me and I wish to work hard and make it into this field and contributing to the society.

Back in 2013, I took an official IQ test at UIUC.  
The result turned out to be 117, and back then I really did not have a care about my result.  
It was more like ""oh well cool I guess?""  
Even the researchers there told me that I do have an IQ that is 1 std above the average. However, the measuring of intelligence is very vague, so it may not be all that accurate.

About a year and a half ago, my friend introduced me to a prominent psychologist named Jordan Peterson.  
I consumed all of his contents, and sometimes I would find myself watching his videos for 6 hours straight. Since college has started, I no longer really watch his contents that much but there is one thing that bothers me.

There is one of his lecture which you can find on youtube called ""Occupation and IQ"" or something along with that nature.

It turns out as for most engineering field, IQ of 130 is minimum. As for data science, it turns out you need to have an IQ of 150 (3 std up above the average population).

The truth is that IQ is purely genetic (meaning you cannot improve your IQ and at best you can up about 2 points basis), and it is in fact a good way to measure your intelligence and success besides consciousness. That is why, as Peterson claimed that White and Asian Male in America tends to be more successful, and minorities have it a hard time to make a living.

This somewhat made me think if I should even try to become a data scientist.

Even software engineering needs an IQ of 130. 

Jordan Peterson said that there would be a slight variation and outliers but it is going to be much harder for IQ 117 to compete with IQ 150, especially in the field like data science.

However, the reason I'm posting here is that I feel like an IQ of 150 is a bit too high. I would understand if it is around IQ of 140 which is the average IQ for a physics professor. So that means data scientist are more intelligent than physics professor?

3. Stats used to evaluate the matchups each player is in

As of now, I have only worked with one set of data (2018 season, week 17) for one position (quarterback). Before I scale the program for other weeks/positions, I was hoping to get some feedback. I will appreciate any and all feedback. Some of the things I have in mind are:

1. How are my function comments? Are they too specific or are they ok?
2. How is my code design? Can anything be done to make it more elegant/efficient? Would an OOP approach help and what might that look like?
3. Are my use of the pandas methods merge, concat, etc. efficient? I am thinking maybe those could be more efficient, in light of all of the renaming and dropping I did.
4. Anything and everything else!

A little bit about me - I am mostly self-taught, but have taken an intro to computer science class at a university. We got through OOP, but most of the OOP concepts are a bit of a head-scratcher for me haha.

My conversion to liking R,"Whilst working in industry I had used python and so it was natural for me to use python for data science. I understand that it's used for ML models in production due to easy integration. ( ML team of previous workplace switched from R to Python). I love how easy it  is to Google stackoverflow and find dozens pages with solutions.

Now that I'm studying masters in data analytics I see the benefits of R. It's used in academia, even had a professor tell me off for using python on a presentation lol. But it just feels as if it was designed for data analytics, everything from the built in functions for statistical tests to customisation of ggplot just screams quality and efficiency.

Python is not R and that's ok, they were designed for different purposes. They each have their benefits and any data scientist should have them both in their toolkit.",datascience,1569527475,LjungatheNord,141,237,True,2019-09-26

Help choosing between a data science role or a data analyst role,"I am currently in a master's program for Business Analytics. My program gives me alot of freedom in elective courses to decide if I want to go heavy into the data science side or more of the business facing side for my career. I am currently in the process of applying and interviewing for internship positions for next summer and I am struggling to decide on which type of roles I want to tell employers that I want to focus on. I have had the question asked in several interviews and I am struggling to give a straight answer since I have a strong interest in both. Hopefully some on this sub have had a similar experience and can offer some advice. 

I really enjoy the data science side and am quite good at coding and have no trouble understanding the theory behind the concepts. My holdup is the fact that I am not sure if I want to be stuck on the data science side for my entire career. As I progress through my career I would like to transition more to the business side (but with a strong knowledge in data science/analytics) since I feel this would allow me to best opportunity to progress up the ranks. I have heard from several people that if you start your career in a data science heavy position that it can be difficult to move out of that realm since I would not have the formal MBA training and my work experience would be in data science instead of a tradition business field. 

The reason I am hesitant to jump straight into an analyst role is because I would like to continue refining my technical skills since I think having expertise in that area will help me stand out when it comes time for promotions. 

In a perfect world I would work in a data science role for a few years and then transition out of it to a more traditional business analyst role at a more senior level to help progress my career.

I had a technical phone interview a couple of days back with a big tech company for machine learning swe position. Interviews are hard to come by and I was really excited about this one. 

When it began, from the get go, I was struggling to understand what the interviewer was saying. It wasn't his English. It was bad audio quality (probably caused by echo in an empty room he was in) and his fast talking style, which made it difficult. I was literally leaning towards my phone which was on speaker,each time he spoke. I tried my best to repeat things which I didn't fully grasp (very frequently).

I didn't do well on the interview. It was my first, and felt I was rushing into answers coz he was talking so fast, and at times I zoned out thinking about how poorly it was going. 
I did answer the programming question.

"If I want to change careers into Data Science and Analytics, should I go back to university for a masters degree, or use the internet and teach myself?","I'll put the TLDR here: 


I am trying to change careers from a completely unrelated job and educational background into DS, and I am keen on going back to school if that is the most efficient path forward to meet my goals since I don't have any debt to my name.  I have changed jobs recently and started working for a ride share company while studying GRE material as well as DS related subjects in MOOCs, in order to see if I am serious about this. It seems like I am, and so I'm trying to dig deeper.  Should I put my money where my mouth is, and get a formal education?



Here is the more detailed version:


I have a bachelors in International Business that I received overseas in Japan at no cost, meaning I have no debt to speak of.

I have recently turned 30 and my only professional experience is working as a an administrative assistant / sales / everything for a small international startup in car parts manufacturing.  I was really a stopgap for the company as their first hire for this new US office, and the only fluently English speaking staff, and realized 2 years in at this job that I would not have luck transferring any of these soft skills in the future to another place. Tariffs also prompted them to open an office in Mexico as well simultaneously, with the goal being to put eventually plants in one or both of the locations if things work out. The work was tedious, my brain felt as if it was rotting away, and the culture was horrendous with so much overtime.  Although, seeing the seedy underbelly of manufacturing around the world was such an eye opening experience that I am happy to have been able to witness firsthand.  That is another story.  But the idea of people in our home company overseas emailing PDF documents back and fourth because they can't figure out Google Drive was the type of thing that drove me to the edge and made me question what I was doing there.  My boss, the only other employee, had never managed anyone before or lived in the US before, and my training was very minimal.  Granted, this was understood from the start at my interview (although I didn't realize the sheer extent of how ""kangaroo country"" it would be). It was definitely a learning experience which I love, but I didn't see a path forward here, nor with my current ""skillset"" of being able to understand someone tell me in Japanese to open the excel file he just emailed me because AirDrop functionality escapes him.  And so now I am driving for Uber, got a couple of great old friend roommates to help boost my spirits up and my ability to pay rent up, and I am plowing away at studies also to take the GRE soon.  I finally have decided I need to buckle down, learn some hard skills, and take my career somewhere that I WANT to go.  So I have also been working though MOOCs online for data science related topics, so Python and stats, although to be honest, it all seems a bit too light and/or unstructured.  I didn't have any of these classes in Japan during undergrad, nor in high school. It was very liberal arts. 

I have no qualms about going back to school, but i would like to know if a masters degree in Math or Statistics would be better than CS for getting a Data Analytics job (which would be my first job in the field, correct?).  Or should I keep studying on my own, and get a low level Data Analytics job, and THEN go back for a CS or Stats degree?  I feel like many people don't go back to school because they are already in debt, but in my case, I don't mind doing that.  I'd rather be in debt doing something I love with some disposable income too than where I have been for the past several years cleaning up everyones shit for pennies.  Its time for change.

Github Releases Dataset Of Six Million Methods From Open Source Projects For CodeSearchNet Challenge,"&gt;[Introducting The Github CodeSearchNet Challenge](https://github.blog/2019-09-26-introducing-the-codesearchnet-challenge/?utm_campaign=1569513857&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_content=1569513857)  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; Searching for code to reuse, call into, or to see how others handle a problem is one of the most common tasks in a software developer’s day. However, search engines for code are often frustrating and never fully understand what we want, unlike regular web search engines. We started using modern machine learning techniques to improve code search but quickly realized that we were unable to measure our progress. Unlike natural language processing with [GLUE](https://gluebenchmark.com/) benchmarks, there is no standard dataset suitable for code search evaluation.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;We collected a large dataset of functions with associated documentation written in Go, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python, and Ruby from open source projects on GitHub. We used our [TreeSitter](http://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) infrastructure for this effort, and we’re also releasing our [data preprocessing pipeline](https://github.com/github/CodeSearchNet/tree/master/function_parser) for others to use as a starting point in applying machine learning to code. While this data is not directly related to code search, its pairing of code with related natural language description is suitable to train models for this task. Its substantial size also makes it possible to apply high-capacity models based on modern [Transformer](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/08/transformer-novel-neural-network.html) architectures.  
&gt;  
&gt;Our fully preprocessed CodeSearchNet Corpus is available for [download on Amazon S3](https://github.com/github/CodeSearchNet#downloading-data-from-s3), including:  
&gt;  
&gt;**Six million methods overall**

How to identify similar datasets based on multiple temporal variables?,"I have a dataset that describes movie releases, i.e. day by day number of seats allocated to the movie and number of seats sold at different geographic locations. This dataset looks something like this:

|Country ID|City ID|Movie ID|Date|Release Day|Seat Count|Seat Sold Count|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|1|1|2019-01-01|\-14|5000|500|
|1|1|1|2019-01-02|\-13|5000|300|
|1|1|1|2019-01-03|\-12|9000|700|

&amp;#x200B;

This example dataset describes three days of a movie pre-release (thus the negative release day), and it says that on the first day when showtimes were published 5000 seats were allocated to the movie and 500 seats were sold on that day. Next day there were still 5000 seats allocated and another 300 were sold, etc.

Release Day is normalised to represent the same period in the movie release window across all movies, i.e. release day 1 will always be Monday of the first isoWeek that contains the showtimes.

My dataset describes couple of thousand movies across different cities. My task is given 1 movie release identify other movie releases that behaved similar at the same point in time in the past.

Ideally, I am looking to do this in PostgreSQL, but it could be done outside of the database too.

Any thoughts on Tomi Mester from Data36?,"I’ve been a digital strategist for the better part of my career (and adulthood) and in an effort to remain relevant and employable, I have been toying with the idea of transitioning into cyber security or going down deeper the rabbit hole (or so I think) of digital strategy by arming myself with data science and analytics skill sets. I’ve registered for a Data Science certificate course with Ryerson University in Toronto and thought I get a head start by doing some self study. Through the course of my research I came across Tomi Mester where his 4 untold truths about data science hit home. He sounds like the real deal but thought I ask some budding data science honchos and aspirants here. Has anyone taken his course?

"Not your typical ""industry -&gt; back to school to pursue a PhD"" post. Your feedback is super important to me.","This is a big decision for me to make and I feel that there is no better place for me to look for for some support than this community, so I’m hoping you’ll bear with the length of this post and provide some solid feedback. From the older posts I’ve reviewed where people were asking about pursuing a PhD, I didn’t find any contexts that are similar to mine which is why I chose to write this post at length. There are several questions at the end of this post that I’m looking for concrete answers to.

**The context**

I started a specialized diploma in applied computer science in 2012, got super interested in data science and dropped out to pursue a self-study path through Coursera, just before MOOCs were mainstream. I have been working in the software industry for seven years: 3 years as a software engineer and 4 years as a data scientist. Unfortunately, I’ve been the only data scientist in the three different organizations I’ve been employed at and haven’t had the opportunity to grow as a professional data scientist (which isn’t to say I have grown as a data scientist or professionally).

Within a professional context, I have learned a lot about business, business and data strategy, scoping data problems, and software development and have had the opportunity to work on a lot of end-to-end data problems (none of which made it to production) but, ultimately, I don’t feel like I’ve delivered much tangible value to the organizations I’ve worked at while in a data scientist role. My work has mainly positioned them well with POCs and educated them on internal and customer-facing use cases. I’ve also never had anyone validate my approaches or results - the closest I get are responses from the online community to questions I post when I’m really stuck.  

Over the past few years, my understanding of applied predictive analytics (ML in the context of real world problems) and inferential statistics has improved mostly from countless hours of learning concepts. It pains me to say I’ve completed a total of three portofolio-worthy projects which are mediocre at best (e.g. achieving an F1-Score of .73 on a real-world multi-class classification task I completed for work) and have only participated in two Kaggle competitions, ranking low on the leaderboards. I’m totally aware that more of my time should have been spent completing projects and building my portfolio rather than learning. Reflecting on my interest in learning over implementing has hinted toward the fact that I will probably enjoy a career in research. 

So all of this, coupled with a strong interest in AI (beyond deep neural nets - pretty much all of the content in AIMA by Nerving and Russel), statistics, biology, math, and solving hard problems has me seriously considering going back to school to complete an undergrad then post-grad programs. I’m sure being jaded has something to do with it, but I’ve become quite depressed at thought of the path I’m on, being stuck in this data science-team-of-one-with-no-production-projects role. Even if I get to do real “data science”, I don’t like the thought of working directly on impacting the bottom-line. I want to do *science,* work on the cutting edge, and have a larger impact with my work. I’m fine if it indirectly impacts the bottom line.

**The plan**

1. Completing my diploma in Q1 2020 with a comprehensive project to demonstrate my industry experience
2. Going back to school in Q3 2020 to complete my CS BSc within 1.5 years - 2 years (thanks to a local college / university partnership that I qualify for after completing #1)
3. Enrolling in a MSc program in 2022
4. Hopefully fast-tracking to a PhD program by 2023
5. Getting an (ideally) high-paying research position as a scientist doing work that I’m passionate about

I would love to work for a big tech firm like Microsoft, DeepMind, Netflix or a company doing precision medicine like [https://www.deepgenomics.com/](https://www.deepgenomics.com/). 

I want to clarify that my motivation for doing a PhD is not money-driven, but it would be nice if my hiatus from full-time employment for 8 years pays off from a financial perspective. To be clear, I’m interested in a PhD because I want to be immersed in a field of study that I’m passionate about, become an expert in it, and do proper science to advance that field.

Here is where it gets tricky:

* I’ll need to work part-time (thinking 20 hours / week)
   * This might be possible at my current employer, definitely doable at a previous employer.
   * My strategy is to negotiate a higher salary to offset reduced work hours.
* I want to get married and start a family within the next 5 years
   * My girlfriend and soon-to-be fiancé (she doesn’t know it yet) is ultra-supportive of this move.
* I still want to make &gt;= $150K annually (after completing my PhD) to support the lifestyle I want for me and my (future) family
* The computer science department at the local university doesn’t appear to have strong AI research areas (see [https://www.csd.uwo.ca/research/ai\_\_games.html](https://www.csd.uwo.ca/research/ai__games.html))

**My questions for you**  

Career:

* Does this sound like a reasonable path to take, given my career trajectory to date and passion for research? Am I sabotaging my career? To provide some more context, data scientists are in low demand in the area (lots of tech companies but most are late majority / laggards when it comes to creating a DS capability) and are paid less than software engineers.
* Are there still going to be lucrative career opportunities in AI in the next five to ten years for a 37-40 year old, doing ultra-specialized work in e.g. computational genomics?
* If I complete a PhD in a focussed area like computational genomics as opposed to machine learning / deep neural nets, will the big tech companies still consider me for research positions?

Academic:

* Am I able to find a research topic that really interests me or does the university faculty need to have expertise in the specific topic that I’m interested in? E.g. if I wanted to do research in large-scale casual inference in genomics, does a faculty member need to already be doing research in this area?
* Is there such a thing as leveraging expertise from two different faculties / doing a PhD that spans multiple disciplines e.g. statistics and computer science? 
* What are some open research areas in AI that excite you and that will still be relevant in the next ten years? I want to future-proof my move in the best way that I can.
* Math is a weak point for me - I’ll be taking some math courses in the CS BSc program but not sure if it will be enough for a grad program? Should I look at doing a minor in math instead of statistics or specialization in bioinformatics?

Cover letter assistance,"I will begin applying to data science positions from tomorrow (graduating in 2020) and I need some advice of how my cover letter looks. It all fits on one page of A4.


Dear Sir/Madam,

Your position for a quantitative research intern is of great interest to me. I am a third-year physicist at Imperial College London with programming knowledge looking to gain experience in the data science industry. I am certain that with my skillset I can be a great addition to your team.

An internship at Impact Information Company has given me a glimpse into what a career in data science and quantitative research will entail. A large portion of my time was data wrangling which taught me how to handle unprocessed data and how to manipulate it to achieve the desired results. The unprocessed data was analysed further through web scraping and applying Natural Language Processing alongside a machine learning algorithm to fit our specific requirements. I then applied this data to automatically create Tableau workbooks for clients based on the specific data required by each client. Time series analysis was then conducted on data in postal districts across the UK to predict the growth of industries and how social investors can impact the growth in a positive manner. My skills showed great improvement and were indispensable to the company, so I was asked to continue working even after completing the internship.

Completing the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate has provided me with the skills needed to further flourish in data science. I can now build machine learning models such as KNN, k means clustering, logistic regression and evaluate their effectiveness as well as being able to refine the models to be able to achieve the highest accuracy for the relevant data. I can also apply extensive statistical analysis to the results to be able to determine how well it fits the desired outcome.

My background in a scientific environment alongside my enthusiasm for programming and data analysis make me a suitable candidate for this position. My experience will allow me to contribute to G Research while learning and gaining invaluable experience about the practical applications of quantitative analytics in the industry.

Thank you for taking the time to read this and I hope to hear from you soon.

Mid career advice for an ML generalist: Update,"[A few weeks ago I posted that I was having trouble with mid-senior level interviews.](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/d0qz6h/mid_career_advice_for_an_ml_generalist/) Since then I’ve changed a few things and had much better responses (3 onsite invitations and 2 offers). I've just signed an offer that I’m pretty happy with, and wanted to update you on some of the things that I think helped the most.

# Company size

I was applying pretty randomly to a lot of different size companies, turns out my sweet spot seems to be startups with 10-20 employees who don’t have an ML manager yet. (I don't have enough management experience to go for manager roles at larger companies). I think this is because I’ve had too many experiences with bad managers that I don’t really trust them, so I probably put out a prickly vibe in interviews that puts people off.

# Age(ism)

I do a lot better when interviewed by older people, like 40-50+, they seem to have more respect for my PhD and life experience rather than just trying to catch me out on something I don’t know off the top of my head. Luckily the tech bubble (e.g. 20-year old founders of [juice startups](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bizcarson/2017/09/01/silicon-valleys-infamous-400-juicer-startup-is-shutting-down/)) is settling down, I think I read somewhere that most successful startups are actually founded by 40+ year olds, so hopefully the industry will go more back to the way it was in the 80s and 90s.

# Statistics

I’ve never really got statistics on a deep level (my PhD is in pure math) so have always struggled with stats questions in interviews, e.g. “there are two groups of users each one does a certain number of clicks per day, how do you know if one is more than the other.” Stats just seemed like a random bag of z scores and t tests and I don’t even really believe in p-values; I’d remember enough to stumble my way thorough, and then say something about bootstrapping confidence intervals when I couldn’t, but it made me come across as pretty weak. What turned it around for me was reading “Rethinking Statistics”: writing out the equations for statistical models gives me confidence when I’m talking ( I come from a math background) and then I can just say that I would run Bayesian inference to get the coefficients. 

I’ve also screwed up a few interviews with time series data from sensors (outlier detection etc) ... I still don’t really know how to approach these. 

# ML models 

This was one of the biggest things I was doing wrong in retrospect. When I was asked “tell me something you’ve done that you’re proud of” I’d tell stories about powerful business results I’d achieved using simple models like heuristics, logistic regression or random forests together with more organisational things like clarifying metrics and objective functions with stakeholders, product/design thinking, evolving data-labeling practices, and testing models in production as soon as possible. 

Lol turns out people don’t want to hear about any of this, maybe it made them think that I just plug data into a black box and don’t understand how it works? Anyway things turned around for me when I dropped all the business stuff and started just talking about (the one time) when I read a research paper, implemented the algorithm in PyTorch and got a meaningful gain in accuracy. 

# Engineering

You guys were right, I didn't need more engineering experience, I'm already pretty strong for a data scientist, I was just doubting myself due to my current company (which doesn't have a data science org) gaslighting me into taking a lower pay grade.

Anyway hope this is useful to some of you, definitely going to approach my next job search differently although maybe things will be different by then anyway and I might be going for more management-level roles.

"People who are training on hundreds of millions of rows, what's precluding you from a sampling approach?","As a ""data science "" newb, coming from a statistics background where smaller data is the norm and sampling is ubiquitous, when I see people here talking about the strategies for manipulating their massive datasets, I suppose they have good reasons to need to do that -- but in the same discussions, I see stuff about perfect being the enemy of good in a modeling context, get 90% of the way their today instead of 99% percent of the way their next month, etc.  I'm aware that in some extraordinary contexts you need everything you can get and more, but in most such cases, how much can you really be losing by sampling down a couple orders of magnitude?

I'd like to hear about what kind of constraints you all are encountering in your work that require engaging deeply with the full don't-fit-on-your-RAM.  Is it massive dimensionality (if so, how do you handle that with so many rows)?  Hyper-rare outcomes?  Hundreds of millions already IS the sample from something even more unwieldy?

Should I quit my data science job in industry and go back to school at 30 to complete an undergrad degree and a PhD in AI?,"This is a big decision for me to make and I feel that there is no better place for me to look for for some support than this community, so I’m hoping you’ll bear with the length of this post and provide some solid feedback. I've reviewed other similar posts re. going back to school to pursue a PhD, but did not find any with a similar context, which is why I chose to write this post at length. There are several questions at the end of this post that I’m looking for concrete answers to.

**The context**

I started a specialized diploma in applied computer science in 2012, got super interested in data science and dropped out to pursue a self-study path through Coursera, just before MOOCs were mainstream. I have been working in the software industry for seven years: 3 years as a software engineer and 4 years as a data scientist. Unfortunately, I’ve been the only data scientist in the three different organizations I’ve been employed at and haven’t had the opportunity to grow as a professional data scientist (which isn’t to say I have grown as a data scientist or professionally).

Within a professional context, I have learned a lot about business, business and data strategy, scoping data problems, and software development and have had the opportunity to work on a lot of end-to-end data problems (none of which made it to production). Ultimately, I don’t feel like I’ve delivered much tangible value to the organizations I’ve worked at while in a data scientist role. My work has mainly positioned them well with POCs and educated them on internal and customer-facing use cases. I’ve also never had anyone validate my approaches or results - the closest I get are responses from the online community to questions I post when I’m really stuck.

Over the past few years, my understanding of applied predictive analytics (ML in the context of real world problems) and inferential statistics has improved mostly from countless hours of learning concepts and speaking with business stakeholders. It pains me to say I’ve completed a total of three portofolio-worthy projects which are mediocre at best (e.g. achieving an F1-Score of .73 on a real-world multi-class classification task I completed for work) and have only participated in two Kaggle competitions, ranking low on the leaderboards. I’m totally aware that more of my time should have been spent completing projects and building my portfolio rather than learning. Reflecting on my interest in learning over implementing has hinted toward the fact that I will probably enjoy a career in research.

So all of this, coupled with a strong interest in AI (more agent-based models rather than DNNs, like the content in AIMA by Norvig and Russel), statistics, biology, math, and solving hard problems has me seriously considering going back to school to complete an undergrad then post-grad programs. I’m sure being jaded has something to do with it, but I’ve become quite depressed at thought of the path I’m on, being stuck in this data science-team-of-one-with-no-production-projects role. Even if I get to do ""real"" data science, I don’t like the thought of working directly on impacting the bottom-line. I want to do *science,* work on the cutting edge, and have a larger impact with my work. I’m fine if my work indirectly impacts the bottom line.

**The plan**

1. Completing my diploma in Q1 2020 with a comprehensive project to demonstrate my industry experience
2. Going back to school in Q3 2020 to complete my CS BSc within 1.5 years - 2 years (thanks to a local college / university partnership that I qualify for after completing #1)
3. Enrolling in a MSc program in 2022
4. Hopefully fast-tracking to a PhD program by 2023
5. Getting an (ideally) high-paying research position as a scientist doing work that I’m passionate about by 2028

I would love to work for a big tech firm like Microsoft, DeepMind, Netflix or a company doing precision medicine like [https://www.deepgenomics.com/](https://www.deepgenomics.com/).

I want to clarify that my motivation for doing a PhD is not money-driven, but it would be nice if my hiatus from full-time employment for 8 years pays off from a financial perspective. To be clear, I’m interested in a PhD because I want to be immersed in a field of study that I’m passionate about, become an expert in it, and do proper science to advance that field. I feel going back to school will also help develop my critical thinking skills which I feel need work.

Here is where it gets tricky:

* I’ll need to work part-time throughout this whole endeavour (thinking 20 hours / week)
   * This might be possible at my current employer, definitely doable at a previous employer.
   * My strategy is to negotiate a higher salary to offset reduced work hours.
* I want to get married and start a family within the next 5 years
   * My girlfriend and soon-to-be fiancé (she doesn’t know it yet) is ultra-supportive of this move.
* I still want to make &gt;= $150K annually (after completing my PhD) to support the lifestyle I want for me and my (future) family
* The computer science department at the nearest university (Western University, formerly UWO) doesn’t appear to have strong AI research areas (see [https://www.csd.uwo.ca/research/ai\_\_games.html](https://www.csd.uwo.ca/research/ai__games.html))

**My questions for you**

Career:

* Does this sound like a reasonable path to take, given my career trajectory to date and passion for research? Am I sabotaging my career? To provide some more context, data scientists are in low demand in the area (lots of tech companies but most are late majority / laggards when it comes to creating a DS capability) and are paid less than software engineers.
* Are there still going to be lucrative career opportunities in AI in the next five to ten years for a 37-40 year old, doing ultra-specialized work in e.g. computational genomics?
* If I complete a PhD in a focussed area like computational genomics as opposed to machine learning / deep neural nets, will the big tech companies still consider me for research positions?
* One of my biggest fears is that by the time I’m done my PhD, technology will have advanced so much that either my expertise will become outdated or the problems will have already been solved. Is this a rational fear?

Academic:

* Am I able to find a research topic that really interests me or does the university faculty need to have expertise in the specific topic that I’m interested in? E.g. if I wanted to do research in large-scale casual inference in genomics, does a faculty member need to already be doing research in this area?
* Is there such a thing as leveraging expertise from two different faculties / doing a PhD that spans multiple disciplines e.g. statistics and computer science?
* What are some open research areas in AI that excite you and that will still be relevant in the next ten years? I want to future-proof my move in the best way that I can.
* Math is a weak point for me - I’ll be taking some math courses in the CS BSc program but not sure if it will be enough for a grad program? Should I look at doing a minor in math instead of statistics or specialization in bioinformatics?
* What are some interesting research areas in agent-based modelling?

a Question about OLAP,"Hi  
I have very Important Question if someone please has the right answer cause it i need it in my examination  
Im readying about Date Warehousing and Olap I have read a text that i didn't exactly understand if someone can clear this point to me i will be thankful:  


In the following, we address the problem of finding granular temporal trends

in data warehouses by proposing two new OLAP operators, namely, Trend and

TrendAggregator. The first operator exploits the hierarchical structure of dimensions

in order to find trends of possibly aggregated data at some granularity

level. It allows users to use standard OLAP operations for retrieving time series

at the desired level of detail, as a mean to find trends that yield decision-making,

e.g., “Display for each product, the positive trends in days for each quarter of

2013.” The second operator allows users to further investigate the discovered

trends, represented by means of a multidimensional model. This operator aggregates

trends on the dimension hierarchies, e.g., “Display for each city, the longest

trends between days of 2013.

&amp;#x200B;

there is 2 OLAP operator Trend and TrendAggregator: but i didn't understand the deference between them i have read the text and search about that but nothing. can anyone please tell me the deference and explain what is the deference between both examples:

1- “Display for each product, the positive trends in days for each quarter of 2013.”  
2-   “Display for each city, the longest trends between days of 2013.

Approaching Small Businesses for free consulting?,"I need another personal project to put on my resume, and I'd like to work with some unique data to extract insights. Only issue is that I'm not sure where to look.

Only issue is that I a lot of small businesses don't know where to start when it comes to data. For example, if I walked into my local mom and pop gym, looked them in the eyes, and said ""I want to analyze your data"" they'd probably tell me to get out.

Extracting data from scanned spreadsheets,"I have a bunch of data on printed spreadsheets.

Leaning toward government data analysis job but afraid I'll be trapped.,"I graduated a few months ago from a fairly well-regarded data analytics masters program on the west coast of the US.

Effective practices for scraping using a macro.,"From the article: https://www.stats-et-al.com/2019/09/tips-to-successfully-web-scrape-with.html

Prep Principle A: Do whatever you can programmatically first.

As prep, I build a list with two URLs for each match, one for the commentary of each innings, for an Indian Premier League (IPL) season. This list was generated through some string manipulation with stringr, but mostly through the getHTMLlinks() function in Rvest.


Prep Principle B: Plan out your goal and the steps needed as explicitly as possible.

We need, from each of these pages, to highlight all the text and save it into a text file so that we can filter it down to the play-by-play commentary later. We do this by…


1. Taking the first URL in the list, cutting it (and thereby removing it from the list),

2. Pasting it into navigation bar of the browser, pressing enter,

3. Waiting for the page to load, pressing 'down' or 'page down' until the end of the page is reached,

4. Selecting all (Crtl + A or command + A), and copy/pasting all of this into a waiting txt file.

 Repeat this process hundreds of times.



The main principle is to minimize variation. That means do whatever you can before recording your macro to make sure that it's doing exactly the same thing as you did when you recorded it.


Principle 1) Close every non-essential window, especially ones that might create pop-up messages. If the webpages you're scraping have pop-ups or elements that might inconsistently disrupt scraping, use a script blocker.


 Principle 2) Write down the windows that are open, and what arrangement they're in. 


As a human, you can see when, say, the 'notepad' window is on the left half of the screen instead of the right, but a macro is just blindly repeating previously recorded clicks and key presses.


 In my macro, four windows are open: A notepad with the URLs, a notepad to paste raw text into, a web browser, and Automation. They appear in my taskbar in exactly that order.


Principle 3) Use the keyboard whenever possible. (Instead of clicking and dragging to highlight text, use Crtl + A)


Principle 4) When you must use the mouse, only interact with things that will always be in the same place and that you can control.


For example: You can paste something to the navigation bar, but avoid clicking on links if possible.


Why? Because webpage layouts change often, and that link may be somewhere else later, even a few pixels of difference can result in a link not being clicked.


Principle 5) Don't give you macro opportunities to 'wander'.


Specifically, don't use navigation buttons like 'back'.


If something unusual happens like a page fails to load, or the expected page isn't there (say, due to a cancelled or abandoned match), then the back button might not bring to you your previous page, but the page BEFORE that.


Likewise, don't open the start menu during your macro, because later you might end up opening an unexpected program.


Changing the active window with alt + tab is also dangerous because that shortcut depends on the order that windows were last active, which is difficult to keep track of, and needs to be the same as it was in the 'home state' (see Principle 7).


Principle 6) When interacting with things you can't control, leave wide margins for error.

That means waiting extra time for web pages to load. In the case of scrolling webpages, it means pressing 'down' or 'page down' about twice as much as necessary for a typical web page.


Principle 7) Return to the 'home state' at the end of the macro. That means have the same window active at the end of the recorded macro as you did at the start. If possible, put the keyboard cursor is the same place as when you started. 


In the example macro, each time I use a URL, I remove it from the list, so that the top line of the URL list is a new URL each loop, this allows me to set my home state to the very top-left of the URL notepad file without having to count keypresses. Instead, I just click anywhere in that notepad and press 'Crtl + Home' to get to the beginning.",datascience,1569860659,factotumjack,3,1,True,2019-09-30

Best degree for the industry?,"&amp;#x200B;

Which one of these 2 year Master's programs would be best suited for getting into the industry?

I've read about how skeptical the industry was about Machine Learning degrees showing a preference for other Quantitative/CompSci degrees. Is Computer Science that much shinier on a CV or is the extra focus and room to specialize in the ML degree more worth it? What about Applied &amp; Computational Maths?

Optimal cut off value of continuous variable in risk model,"Be it logistic or survival analysis/cox regression, there  is utility in determining cutoff points to categorise a continuos risk factor into various risk strata.

However there is a plethora or methods to go about defining the 'optimal' value depending on the nature of the model outcome. Generally they fall into methods that look at the model's sensitivity and specificity or methods that look to maximise the p value of significant difference between the survival curves of the resulting stratas. 

Currently, i'm modeling the risk of body mass index on diagnosis of certain medical conditions through survival analysis to identify at risk individuals since the current bmi risk groupings prove inadequate to stratefy risk groups. For my purposes, i'm thinking of going with a method to maximise sensitivity with maintaining a certain threshold of specificity ,instead if going eith the standard procedure to maximise the youden index , since the cost of misclassifying in the model isn't a great deal. 

The issue im facing is how to justify the specificity threshold chosen? Or is there a better method of determining the best cut off to use for catorising bmi risk groups. Also , how to determine the number of categories? 

The implementation of this in R is also shrouded in difficulty and the packages i found are unclear in the innerworkings of the functions.

Question about combining two datasets with different time step measurements.,"Hello.

I have a problem that I thought people here might have some tips on how to deal with this.

The problem: I have two datasets measuring different things about the same process. Let's say that Dataset 1 contains data on a per 90 minutes basis, while Dataset 2 contain data on a per 1 minute basis. 

Their features are all different but to have some idea of size, Dataset 1 is about 1k rows while Dataset 2 reaches 90k.

The question is: I want to keep as much information as possible to eventually use in the machine learning model. What should be the correct way to combine these information?

Option 1 would be to combine the minute-based data into the 90-minute-based data, thus improving Dataset 1 with more features matching the already existing time steps. The resulting dataset would have 1k rows.

Option 2 would be to populate the big dataset 2 with more information from the small dataset. However, every sequential 90min data points would have the same information coming from the the other dataset. The resulting dataset would have 90k rows.

Both datasets contain important features about the process.

Any tips on how to approach this problem? Thanks in advance",datascience,1569939420,ThinSector,12,1,True,2019-10-01

SEC XBRL Financial Statement Dataset Since January 2009,"[SECDatabase.com](https://SECDatabase.com) proudly shares its internal SEC XBRL Financial Statement dataset with the community on a regular basis. The documentation can be found here:

[https://github.com/secdatabase/SEC-XBRL-Financial-Statement-Dataset](https://github.com/secdatabase/SEC-XBRL-Financial-Statement-Dataset)

**FAQ:**

**Q**: What is the data format?

**A**: It is in Parquet format, and optimized for AWS Athena and Redshift Spectrum

**Q**: How is this dataset different from [dataset](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/sec-public-data-bq/sec-public-dataset) hosted on Google Cloud Platform

**A**: The dataset on Google Bigquery is based on Dataset published by SEC (See next question), and is stale - the latest filing data is as of June 2018.

**Q**: How the dataset is different from dataset on SEC website

**A**: This dataset has numerous improvements over the dataset on SEC website such as:

1. Text and notes data are in full-length without truncation. The dataset published by SEC trimed footnote to 512 chars, and string value to 2048 chars only.
2. Report segment information are added to the data points directly.
3. Include the start\_date and end\_date for each data point to reflect the period more accurately.
4. Eliminated the needs to understand the convoluted XBRL convention as much as possible, so that Data Scientist can focus on the data itself to derived the value.
5. Support the tracing of the data point back to its original filing and specific section.
6. Support the tracing of data point revision.

**Q**: Do I need to download the data to query the dataset?

**A**: No, you can use the Athena or Redshift Spectrum in your AWS to query the data directly.

**Q**: What is the coverage of the data?

**A**:  As of August 31, 2019, the dataset covers:

1. All XBRL filings since 2009.
2. 12.6k companies.

Deciding between 4 math courses at my university (UCSD). Which one is most useful for data science?,"I'm a math major at UCSD and I'm required to take exactly 1 of the following 4: 


MATH 154. Discrete Mathematics and Graph Theory (4)

Basic concepts in graph theory, including trees, walks, paths, and connectivity, cycles, matching theory, vertex and edge-coloring, planar graphs, flows and combinatorial algorithms, covering Hall’s theorems, the max-flow min-cut theorem, Euler’s formula, and the travelling salesman problem.



MATH 158. Extremal Combinatorics and Graph Theory (4)

Extremal combinatorics is the study of how large or small a finite set can be under combinatorial restrictions. We will give an introduction to graph theory, connectivity, coloring, factors, and matchings, extremal graph theory, Ramsey theory, extremal set theory, and an introduction to probabilistic combinatorics. Topics include Turan’s theorem, Ramsey’s theorem, Dilworth’s theorem, and Sperner’s theorem.



MATH 184. Enumerative Combinatorics (4)

Introduction to the theory and applications of combinatorics. Enumeration of combinatorial structures (permutations, integer partitions, set partitions). Bijections, inclusion-exclusion, ordinary and exponential generating functions.



MATH 188. Algebraic Combinatorics (4)

A rigorous introduction to algebraic combinatorics. Basic enumeration and generating functions. Enumeration involving group actions: Polya theory. Posets and Sperner property. q-analogs and unimodality. Partitions and tableaux.


I don't really know 80% of the terminology here so it's non-trivial to judge what I would enjoy or what's useful.

Like the python interactive interpreter, you can go line-by-line... but why not just work in code where you can much more easily define classes, functions, etc?  I don't even IDE lol, I just text edit .py files usually and execute from a CMD prompt or bash if on UNIX server.

Noten ook hosting seems to me like a nice gui but the overhead doesn't seem to add any value.

Is there something I'm missing?  Are there some strengths in certain scenarios that I'm not aware of?

Presenting a written analysis for two types of audiences,"For an interview I was ask to do a take home case study. I was asked to present my analysis in a format where it is suitable for a technical individual to verify my work and for a non-technical upper management individual to understand the answers to their questions.

They prefer the analysis to be done in SQL and then have you use an external tool to display any graphs, but they're open to Python and R.

I decided to present my analysis in a Jupyter notebook, because it allows an easy way for me to display graphs to answer some of their questions (explaining and showing a trend for example) and keep my work organized.

Once I'm finished I'll hide the cells that have code blocks, that way if a technical individual wants to verify my work, they can open the cell to do so. While by default, my notebook will only show my explanation of my analysis and along with any visuals. Since they did have a preference for some SQL, I'll include likely include a query on how I would've aggregated the data using SQL somewhere.

Career question for those in DS,"I'll try to make this brief, but I want to add in relevant background so the picture is clear.

I currently work for a F100 company in their marketing and analytics space, where I have 15 years of experience. I am in my late 30's, hold a BS from a BIG10 college (started in CS, switched to MIS because I wanted more of the business aspect). My current job title has nothing to do with my job duties, but suffice it to say I am knee deep in SQL most days.

 Prior this I worked with SAS for about 8 years. I am also the application manager for a marketing application, which involves some Linux scripting, a lot of data exploration and a lot of face time with the lines of business. It's been a while since I've had to flex my math muscles.

I am at a point where I am considering a switch since I will be enrolling in a masters program in the next year. I'm looking at University of Iowa's Business Analytics program, but have been considering leaning more towards the data science role. ML and AI intrigue me and if I don't stay with my current company, I'm considering a switch to the MedTech side.

My current TC is $135k-$145k (cash + bonus). If I were to successfully make a switch to data science, given I do not have the years of experience in that specific career path, how hard do you think it will be to find a role with similar compensation?

Handling Imbalanced Datasets with SMOTE in Python,"The opposite of a pure balanced dataset is a highly imbalanced dataset, and unfortunately for us, these are quite common. An imbalanced dataset is a dataset where the number of data points per class differs drastically, resulting in a heavily biased machine learning model that won’t be able to learn the minority class. When this imbalanced ratio is not so heavily skewed toward one class, such dataset is not *that* horrible, since many machine learning models can handle them. 

Nevertheless, there are some extreme cases in which the class ratio is just wrong, for example, a dataset where 95% of the labels belong to class A, while the remaining 5% fall under class B– a ratio not so rare in use cases such as fraud detection. In these extreme cases, the ideal course of action would be to collect more data. 

However, this is typically not feasible; in fact, it’s costly, time-consuming and in most cases, impossible. Luckily for us, there’s an alternative known as oversampling. Oversampling involves using the data we currently have to create more of it. 

## What is data oversampling?

Data oversampling is a technique applied to generate data in such a way that it resembles the underlying distribution of the real data. In this article, I explain how we can use an oversampling technique called **Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique** or **SMOTE** to balance out our dataset.

## What is SMOTE?

SMOTE is an oversampling algorithm that relies on the concept of nearest neighbors to create its synthetic data. Proposed back in [2002 by Chawla et. al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.1813)., SMOTE has become one of the most popular algorithms for oversampling. 

The simplest case of oversampling is simply called oversampling or upsampling, meaning a method used to duplicate randomly selected data observations from the outnumbered class. 

Oversampling’s purpose is for us to feel confident the data we generate are real examples of already existing data. This inherently comes with the issue of creating more of the same data we currently have, without adding any diversity to our dataset, and producing effects such as overfitting. 

Hence, if overfitting affects our training due to randomly generated, upsampled data– or if plain oversampling is not suitable for the task at hand– we could resort to another, smarter oversampling technique known as synthetic data generation.

Synthetic data is intelligently generated artificial data that resembles the shape or values of the data it is intended to enhance. Instead of merely making new examples by *copying* the data we already have (as explained in the last paragraph), a synthetic data generator *creates* data that is similar to the existing one. Creating synthetic data is where SMOTE shines.

## How does SMOTE work?

To show how SMOTE works, suppose we have an imbalanced two-dimensional dataset, such as the one in the next image, and we want to use SMOTE to create new data points.

![example of an imbalanced dataset](https://kite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/imbalance-dataset.jpg)

Example of an imbalanced dataset

For each observation that belongs to the under-represented class, the algorithm gets its K-nearest-neighbors and synthesizes a new instance of the minority label at a random location in the line between the current observation and its nearest neighbor. 

In our example (shown in the next image), the blue encircled dot is the current observation, the blue non-encircled dot is its nearest neighbor, and the green dot is the synthetic one.

SMOTE’s new synthetic data point

Now let’s do it in Python.



## SMOTE tutorial using imbalanced-learn

In this tutorial, I explain how to balance an imbalanced dataset using the package [**imbalanced-learn**](https://imbalanced-learn.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). 

First, I create a perfectly balanced dataset and train a machine learning model with it which I’ll call our “**base model****”**. Then, I’ll unbalance the dataset and train a second system which I’ll call an “**imbalanced model**.”

Finally, I’ll use SMOTE to balance out the dataset, followed by fitting a third model with it which I’ll name the “**SMOTE’d****”** model. By training a new model at each step, We’ll be able to better understand how an imbalanced dataset can affect a machine learning system.

### Base model

*Example code for this article may be found at the* [*Kite Blog repository*](https://github.com/kiteco/kite-python-blog-post-code/tree/master/smote)*.*

For the initial task, I’ll fit a [**support-vector machine**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support-vector_machine) (SVM) model using a created, perfectly balanced dataset. I chose this kind of model because of how easy it is to visualize and understand its decision boundary, namely, the hyperplane that separates one class from the other.

To generate a balanced dataset, I’ll use scikit-learn’s [make_classification](https://kite.com/python/docs/sklearn.datasets.make_classification) function which creates n clusters of normally distributed points suitable for a classification problem. 

My fake dataset consists of 700 sample points, two features, and two classes. To make sure each class is one blob of data, I’ll set the parameter `n_clusters_per_class` to 1. 

To simplify it, I’ll remove the redundant features and set the number of informative features to 2. Lastly, I’ll `useflip_y=0.06` to reduce the amount of noise. 

The following piece of code shows how we can create our fake dataset and plot it using Python’s Matplotlib.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from imblearn.datasets import make_imbalance

# for reproducibility purposes
seed = 100

# create balanced dataset
X1, Y1 = make_classification(n_samples=700, n_features=2, n_redundant=0,
                            n_informative=2, n_clusters_per_class=1,
                            class_sep=1.0, flip_y=0.06, random_state=seed)

plt.title('Balanced dataset')
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('y')
plt.scatter(X1[:, 0], X1[:, 1], marker='o', c=Y1,
           s=25, edgecolor='k', cmap=plt.cm.coolwarm)
plt.show()
# concatenate the features and labels into one dataframe
df = pd.concat([pd.DataFrame(X1), pd.DataFrame(Y1)], axis=1)
df.columns = ['feature_1', 'feature_2', 'label']
# save the dataset because we'll use it later
df.to_csv('df_base.csv', index=False, encoding='utf-8')
```

![a perfectly balanced dataset with 1:1 ratio](https://kite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/balanced-dataset.jpg)

A balanced dataset

As you can see in the previous image, our balanced dataset looks tidy and well defined. So, if we fit an SVM model with this data (code below), how will the decision boundary look?

Since we’ll be training several models and visualizing their hyperplanes, I wrote two functions that will be reused several times throughout the tutorial. The first one, `train_SVM`, is for fitting the SVM model, and it takes the dataset as a parameter. 

The second function, `plot_svm_boundary`, plots the decision boundary of the SVM model. Its parameters also include the dataset and the caption of the plot. 

These are the functions:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.svm import SVC


def train_SVM(df):
   # select the feature columns
   X = df.loc[:, df.columns != 'label']
   # select the label column
   y = df.label

   # train an SVM with linear kernel
   clf = SVC(kernel='linear')
   clf.fit(X, y)

   return clf


def plot_svm_boundary(clf, df, title):
   fig, ax = plt.subplots()
   X0, X1 = df.iloc[:, 0], df.iloc[:, 1]

   x_min, x_max = X0.min() - 1, X0.max() + 1
   y_min, y_max = X1.min() - 1, X1.max() + 1
   xx, yy = np.meshgrid(np.arange(x_min, x_max, 0.02), np.arange(y_min, y_max, 0.02))

   Z = clf.predict(np.c_[xx.ravel(), yy.ravel()])
   Z = Z.reshape(xx.shape)
   out = ax.contourf(xx, yy, Z, cmap=plt.cm.coolwarm, alpha=0.8)

   ax.scatter(X0, X1, c=df.label, cmap=plt.cm.coolwarm, s=20, edgecolors='k')
   ax.set_ylabel('y')
   ax.set_xlabel('x')
   ax.set_title(title)
   plt.show()
```

To fit and plot the model, do the following:

```python
df = pd.read_csv('df_base.csv', encoding='utf-8', engine='python')
clf = train_SVM(df)
plot_svm_boundary(clf, df, 'Decision Boundary of SVM trained with a balanced dataset')
```

![decision boundary of an SVM model trained with a balanced dataset](https://kite.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SVM-Trained-balanced-dataset.jpg)

Blue dots on the blue side and red dots on the red side means that the model was able to find a function that separates the classes

The image above presents the hyperplane of the base model. On it, we can observe how clear the separation between our classes is. However, what would happen if we imbalance our dataset? How would the decision boundary look? Before doing so, let’s imbalance the dataset by calling the function [make_imbalance](https://imbalanced-learn.readthedocs.io/en/stable/generated/imblearn.datasets.make_imbalance.html) from the package, **imbalanced-learn**.

Mathematician with training in nonlinear programming applying to data scientist's positions?," I am a math Ph.D. student who is interested in going to the industry as a Data Scientist after graduation. I will briefly give some background on my education before posing my question, so that it is better understood:

Maths Coursework:

This has been mostly in pure maths: topology, functional analysis, etc, but also include more applied ones(on which I have specialized for the dissertation): convex optimization, nonlinear programming, numerical analysis, linear programming, multiobjective optimization. In addition, I have right now 0 knowledge of inferential stat, but I am confident in probability theory.

Programming:

I just took a year-long course in the Bachelor, but it was mostly Mathematica and some Java, of which I remember nothing honestly. In this course, the content did not include anything of data structures or design and analysis of algorithms, nor databases management systems. I also learned Matlab on my own for implementing algorithms in the bachelor thesis.

The above background was during the Bachelor and Master's program. Now, during the Ph.D. program, I discovered that Machine Learning is the perfect mix (for me) between Nonlinear Optimization, Programming, and applications in the real world, i.e, it is both theoretically interesting and application-oriented. This is the reason why I became so excited to go to industry. Hence, I started learning things on my own(in my little free time) during the last 3 years.

A short summary of things learned:

* Python: I am comfortable implementing optimization algorithms, work with jupyter notebooks and the numpy library (in fact, I had to do this for the dissertation), and doing basic data manipulations and cleaning tasks in pandas. This I learned online, in a platform called Dataquest ([https://app.dataquest.io](https://app.dataquest.io/)). However, I don't think I have enough knowledge to pass an interview in data structures and algorithms(see above).
* Machine Learning: I took a master level course in the topic at the uni (since I am in Germany, we don't have courses in the Ph.D., so this was all in my personal time), which I really enjoyed. Topics included: k-NN, PCA, SVM, NN, etc.
* Taking a course in Databases this semester, which focuses on SQL.
* Taking Deep Learning specialization on Coursera this semester.

Finally, I want to say that I feel totally capable of learning the topics. In fact, with time I intend to take more graduate-level courses available online(for example, Stanford CS231N, CS234, etc) because, in my opinion, online courses may not be rigorous enough. Hopefully, after the defense, I will be able to focus full time on this.

Hence the questions:

* Can I still get hired at this point (I mean, after finishing this semester with the knowledge described above)? I honestly think I am not ready, but I feel confident that I can get decent in a year.
* Am I being too naive in thinking a company would give me a chance?
* What should I do to become more hirable in any case?",datascience,1570013676,magnusseen,10,1,True,2019-10-02

"Anyone else embarrassed of calling themselves a ""data scientist""?","It was proclaimed to be the sexiest title of the decade or something but I think it's quite the opposite.  

Somehow everyone I meet knows a little something about data science and thinks they're a pro. Few weeks ago I was at my dad's Indian friend's place for dinner and he told me about how his 17 year old son ""developed his own Artificial intelligence"". He proceeded to show it off to us. The kid basically just copy pasted a GitHub repo. I mean it's great and everything but definitely not worth showing off an hour's worth of work.

I hate the fact that I am associated with the thousands of people who see a problem and then just throw a bunch of models at the data to see what sticks. What about hyperparameters? Throw a bunch of hyperparameters at it and pick the one with the best results. Boom. Data scientist. Gah. It really makes me cringe when people do that. 

Please. Take the time to really understand the problem. Understand what your input is and how features relate to each other. What is your output and how you would split the data? (These are the questions you need to ask before you do anything). EDA is where you should be spending the bulk of your time so you don't need to waste a lot of time throwing a bunch of models at the problem. 

There's also the onslaught of people who will post ""how do I study to be a data scientist"" one day and then tell people they're a data scientist after watching 5 YouTube videos the next day. On the other hand, knowing linear algebra and statistics doesn't automatically mean you're a ""good"" data scientist. It actually doesn't mean anything at all if you don't know how to apply the things you learn in practice. The more I learn about ""data science"" the less I feel I actually know -- there is just such a vast amount of knowledge. 

What I do know though is that I hate being called a data scientist. Call me anything but that because that title now is essentially a meme now.",datascience,1570021534,M0shka,0,0,True,2019-10-02
WARNING: Data Analytics Bootcamp with Trilogy and The University of Denver.,"My experience at The University of Denver has been that we have had 5 teachers in FOUR months of classes. Each one has quit or ‘moved classes.’ Trilogy has maintained that these ‘adjustments’ allow for us to get a broader teaching style...

When you are learning and have a new teacher rotating basically every session, they have no idea what the instructor before them has delved into and what style they are teaching from.

A few of the teachers would literally stand up with the physically printed solved code and just read from the code while typing it back into their computer. With one teacher, the code wouldn’t work and he basically said ‘You get the jist, but we have to move on for time’s sake...’

Since we are so behind in the curriculum, they have added in Friday night sessions (on top of our 3 other days a week). I understand that I am making an investment in my future, but some balance is needed in life. We still have homework and group projects outside of class. I would say that 80% of us also have full-time jobs.

When we spoke to the administrator about how difficult the situation was, they basically said ‘it has been really hard on us, too, with all of the changes.’ YOU AREN’T PAYING TO LEARN... you are BEING PAID to do your job. Sorry if you feel inconvenienced.

We are happy to invite you to our brand new reddit community:  [**r/VisualSchool**](https://www.reddit.com/r/VisualSchool/) . Here you can learn coding, design, marketing, dev ops, security and many other skills. We want to radically improve the online learning experience by providing a visual map of knowledge trough our innovative learning platforms.

How can we improve our learning platform and help you to learn faster?

Leave us feedback on r/VisualSchool

# Why Visual School?

· **Because learning is slow** – Our current experience learning online is very rough. We are forced to spend lots of time searching for the right material. We are forced to drain lots of energy just to understand the basics.

· **Because we lose focus** – We start learning one thing and then the next few hours we are all over the web trying to put the puzzle together. It’s like going downstairs to dump the trash and returning several hours later after you were attacked by a grizzly bear in Las Vegas.

· **Because we are missing know-how** – On a daily basis we start reading some tutorial and then we find lots of strange unfamiliar concepts. All these gaps in knowledge prevent us from learning fast. Worse they divert our attention away from the main topic.

# How will we learn on Visual School?

· **Elastic lessons** – All the tutorials in Visual School are optimized to be “stretchy”. Depending on how skilled you are you can adjust each part of the lesson to give you more or less content. Users ranging from complete beginners up to experts can consume the same set of tutorials adjusted to their own needs.

· **Speed reading** – All our tutorials will be optimized for speed reading. Our approach is to integrate carefully selected and designed graphics and animations. It will look and feel like a hybrid between text, slideshows and video all optimized for learning fast. The accent is on quality not quantity.

· **Learning map** – Think of it as a subway map. Our aim is to map all the important destinations and focus your attention on what makes the biggest impact in your daily life as a professional. This map will give you awareness of the big picture.

· **Learning goals** – You will be able to setup goals and our platform will help you plan ahead a faster route towards your professional goals. We encourage exploration in all ways and forms, all while maintaining a clear deadline and end-goal.

· **Nano Lessons** – For every new unfamiliar concept you discover in the lesson you will have a mini lesson about it one click away. It will help you focus and stay on track without feeling lost.

# What will Visual School be?

· Visual School is the platform where you can study matching your own level of experience

· Visual School maintains your focus while studying a certain subject.

· Visual School fills in the gaps of knowledge right on the spot.

# Who is the audience for Visual School?

· In this current group we invited only profiles that are either strong developers or strong designers. This selection is a good representation of the audience we are targeting. We intend to reach the global market of developers in the early phase. Our first iteration of content will be about programming.

The ultimate goal of Visual School is to reduce the time spent learning and to increase the time spent coding meaningful projects. Current generation of tutorials does a decent job. The next generation of tutorials will kick ass! We want to lead the way towards this future.

Questions regarding reinforcement learning,"Hello, I recently listened to a podcast episode where they discussed reinforcement learning (link: [https://twimlai.com/twiml-talk-302-deep-reinforcement-learning-for-logistics-at-instadeep-with-karim-beguir/](https://twimlai.com/twiml-talk-302-deep-reinforcement-learning-for-logistics-at-instadeep-with-karim-beguir/)). My understanding from the episode is that the guest argued that a reinforcement learning model always results in an unbiased model (or minimally biased model) given the correct constraints (around 30:00 - 31:30 in the podcast). My first question is if this is possible and how do you know if you have given the correct constraints without having to burn resources trying different solutions? Or is this the only way?  


Furthermore, I have a two more questions regarding reinforcement learning of which I have yet to find answers that i'm happy with (perhaps i'm formulating the questions wrong).   


1) If I use a biased training set while doing imitation learning, can it increase the learning time?  
2) Are there any heuristics for creating a good reward function? In the podcast they talk about a taxi routing problem. My question is then, when the guest says that his company solves the routing problem using a reinforcement learning model, what do they really solve? Is it total time in car per passenger, total miles driven by the taxis, the minimum climate impact and so on? How do you go about formulating your reward function? The training time makes it hard to try many different reward functions which is why i'm looking for tips.   


Note: Exactly what the guest solves is not important to me, but kind of illustrates what I am asking.",datascience,1570035809,123elvesarefake123,1,1,True,2019-10-02

"If data is already loaded in my browser, am I allowed to use it?","**What I want to do:**

How important is data structures knowledge for data scientists ?,"So in an interview I did the other day, one of the question I got asked was a stacks data structure question in python. I could not do the question since all I prepped for was machine learning, statistics, SQL, pandas and numpy manipulation. Even though I am familiar with the data structure, I am completely out of practice since it has been at least a year since I have heard about it. I found out later that the question is rated Medium on Hackerrank (which is very difficult at least for me).

So at this point, my questions are:

1. Are data structures related questions the norm in data scientist position interview? If so, then I will definitely review and learn them.

2. In a real job tho, how important are these knowledges? I am always under the assumption that data scientist are about statistics , machine learning and data cleaning/transformation using pandas. I guess it is not true? Do I need trees traversal algorithms to do work as a data scientist for example?

Opinions on graduate school for a career in DS?,"Hello, I hope this is an acceptable question, I did not see anything contrary in the sub rules.

So I am a current undergrad with 3 semesters left, working on a double major in Computer Science / Statistics.

Anyways, what are your opinions on graduate school? Are there any things to keep in mind? How much does the prestige of school actually matter in the work force?

Fuzzy matching multiple data points to find duplicate aid programme participants,"I work for large cash transfer programme in Somalia, funded by the European Union. Instead of giving people food, or paying school fees we give people electronic money to their mobile phones. They know far better what they need than we do. 

In Somalia, there's no ID system so when we register people for a year-long programme we take their names, phone numbers etc. But there's no way for us to definitively determine if someone has registered twice.

Somali names are long (4 names) and spelt more on judgment than convention, so names aren't consistent. Plus, people often have more than one phone number. 

We've tried using fingerprint biometrics, but it was slow, expensive, inaccurate and we're not happy with the data protection risks (certainly the benefits don't outweigh them).

We want to start using fuzzy matching over multiple data points to determine duplicates. Once we have a shortlist, we can use the photos to make a fairly accurate judgement. We have around 75,000 people's records. 

So, what are people's thoughts?

1) hope to leave here
 2) there isn’t much of an industry here, really

Office 365 users : The ultimate danger to your company's security! - Tech Cloud Link," 

No one can deny it, security threats have increased dramatically over the last few years. Record global ransomware attacks have made the headlines recently, focusing the attention once more on the issue of data protection.

The truth is, threats are everywhere and disasters can strike anytime. Business owners have to consider this as a high risk for their organizations and be proactive. No organization is too small to be targeted by a cyber criminal. Moreover, business data is in danger no matter where it’s stored. It doesn’t matter if it’s on-premises or in the cloud.

**Yes, Office 365 is Secure. But Are Users Playing It Safe?**

Microsoft invests a lot in securing its products. Did you know that Office 365 is used by more than 100 million subscribers around the world every month? ¹ This means tens of millions of users are connecting to Microsoft’s online applications around the clock from everywhere in the world. This is only possible because of a highly available infrastructure and protection at all levels. Office 365 services are secure and always on. Access is carefully segregated so organizations only have access to their own data.

Users. Remember, human error is involved in most data breaches: a user’s device is stolen, a weak password is hijacked, a malicious attachment is accidentally opened from a phishing email, an administrator misconfigures the system and exposes data, a computer has not been patched… the list goes on.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;***Human Error Is Involved In Most Data Breaches***

&amp;#x200B;

Some users received phishing emails with  an infected attachment. Because phishing emails are always sent under a legitimate name, it’s a lot easier to trick users to open a malicious document.

Unaware the attachment was malicious, a number of people opened it and enabled macros that automatically encrypted their files, including business data. By the time Microsoft had started blocking the malicious file, many subscribers had already been infected and their data was locked.

 

**Office 365 is Used On Mobile Devices, a High Risk for Business Data**

One of the advantages of Office 365 is that its apps and data can be used on tablets and smartphones. Information like contacts and documents are synced between the devices and the Office 365 servers. But there’s a small problem here. Mobile devices can be easily lost or stolen.

In a recent survey by Lookout, an American security company, 60% of IT admins reported at least one smartphone had been either lost or stolen in the last year. In some cases, the thief wiped out the device intentionally and business data were also deleted on the server-side. The only way to recover deleted information was to restore it from a backup. Mobile devices also carry higher risk because users can download and install applications that no one knows about.

 

# 83% of companies have released applications they know are unsafe.

#  

**Backup is an Alternative to Costly Office 365 Archiving Features SMBs Cannot Afford**

Microsoft gives its customers several payable options to archive data (Exchange Online Archiving), manage document versioning (SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business) and retain deleted items for a desired amount of time.

**Cloud Backup Results in A Better ROI Compared with Traditional Backup**

Traditional backup requires the user to add extra servers, configure libraries and move tapes or other media to dierent locations. It requires some expertise so companies must either hire professionals or deal with a managed service provider (MSP).

**Backup Keeps Businesses Compliant**

The most obvious reason to back up data is to restore information that’s been deleted or compromised in some way. But another equally important reason is to keep businesses in compliance with the growing number of laws regulating how they ensure information is available.

Companies working in the healthcare, finance industry or public trade, for instance, are subject to mandatory government and industry regulations such as Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX), HIPAA and GLBA. While it’s not specifically explained how to retain data, businesses will achieve compliance with an effective backup solution that keep the records for the specified period.

How do you choose the correct approach for a problem?,"Let's say I have a pretty simple problem. I have some input data (for instance, a-b-c-d possible answers to a 10 question test). I have some labels (for instance, if someone has passed the test or not).

Provided that I don't know anything else about the problem (I don't know how much each question is worth, so I don't know the exact criteria to know if someone will pass the test), how would you try to predict the outcome of the test given a set of answers?

The first thing that comes to mind is do a classifier. But the questions arise:

1) How do I know which of them to choose? 

2) How would I know which of them would perform better? 

3) How would I find out which of the questions is more important to determine the outcome of the test?

The team works on prediction problems from image or text using CNN and NLP. As cool as it sounds, it's almost too...cookie-cutter? We literally look at the problem, find a research paper that addresses the problem, and implement the code. Time was spent on writing the pre-processing code and dealing with processing speed issues (set up cloud, now code needs to work on cloud, ...etc). There's not a lot of thinking going on, if at all. 

That said, it's everything a data scientist-wannabe can dream of? My ear should get an orgasm hearing ""using Python to build pipeline and run spark and train a CNN and NLP to predict x on a cloud platform"". If I stick it through, CNN and NLP should also make me very in-demand for the next 5-10 years?

In comparison, my previous position was a research consulting role, where my manager would ask questions and I'll have to answer it with or without the existence of data. Most time was spent thinking about the problem, making careful assumptions, and draw conclusions using limited amount of information. Lots of thinking and exchanging ideas was involved in a project.

An example project was mapping consumers geographically and try to categorize them (apply median HH-income, median house value, proximity to high-end shopping mall...etc.). I'll never get it exactly right, but throughout the process we learn a lot about our consumers.

It sort of dawn upon me that I went for a master so I can answer more complex questions. Although not necessarily using machine learning, my old team was answer questions that are way more interesting. That said, I'm not sure if it's just because I don't have the CS chop yet and when I do work will become more interesting (will it)?

How to methodically create cohorts for an A/B test?,"I'm sorry if this is trivial but I'm very new to the A/B world so I'm not sure what to do and why.

Need some perspective on job offer,"Hi all,

I'm currently a senior analyst (really the only analyst) at a smallish company. I've taught myself python over the last two years, and have adequate math/stats chops. I have degrees in economics and finance (just to make the point my math is on par). Ive been through Thinkful's data science course and use python at work, though mostly for data cleaning and automating certain tasks. 

Long story short I have been through a first round interview at a company that wants to stand up a Data Science department. One more to go and they like me a lot so far.  I'd be the first Data Scientist and have a team of data engineers there. I want to make the jump in to the field, but am unsure if this is a wise way to go about it. I thought there would at least be a bit more senior Data Scientist to kind of look over my shoulder or fill me in on best practices. I don't mind learning a tremendous amount  in a short time, but I'm a bit concerned because I haven't really worked in a legit data science environment. Basically I don't want to mislead anybody and I'm not 100% sure what will be expected. 

As I write I realize I need to dig in to their expectations, but should I be looking more for a role where I'd have a bit more mentorship initially? Can any working Data Scientists offer their thoughts?

"To hire data scientists large companies use, surprise, data science","While generally this is probably not news for most, I was amused by how much data in particular they may get about you. I remember some redditor once submitted a site he wrote, that basically generates a big info about a given username on reddit - age, sex, family, location, hobbies and more. It was just amateur site with open data form one source but people in comments got pretty spooked that algoriphm knows this about them. But they mostly presume they stay anonimous, it's just username after all, but well...

Big companies potentionally know shitton about you(unless you're super cautious to the degree of paranoia), you agreed to their terms and licenses, well who reads these? But by shitton I mean A REAL SHITTON. Including: sexual orientation, political desposition, porn you watch, where you frequent, your spending habits, whether you're on facebook while at work, if you have any extremist views and whatnot. Basically any shit you write on big platforms traces back to you with algorithms in right hands. Even if you use vpn, there are \~60 markers(browser, screen resolution, fonts, etc.) by which a special alorithm may identify you and put a unique label on you which then will trace you to all your public accounts.

While mostly that's used to market and sell you shit you (don't) need, that's also info your insurance company, potential employer or bank might ask to analyze before giving rate/hiring/setting your credit limit. I don't think many people understand that if you have a phone, several social medias(especially linked together) and don't use vpn and deanonymizers, basically everything you write is out in the open for people who can analyze it. Even instagram stories don't dissapear, software can detect some info on it and attach a tag to you.

I learned most of that from [the interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frLydE1UCvA) with one data scientist who specializes on those kind of things, unfortunately it's in russian. 

I don't even know if me having a reddit registered on gmail means my gmail is publicly linked to this account and all info on it, or maybe a mere fact of using Chrome is enough for someone to link my account to everything else. I remember reading a comment like ""who cares if you turn on targeting in reddit, they just ads more relevant"". Well doesn't look like it's a whole picture...

I made it!…now what?!,"I’ll try and keep the backstory brief.  I’m a 40 year old career changer that made it into a data science / data engineering job.  I spent most of my career after undergrad in commercial construction as a project manager and cost estimator.  Around age 36 I started a part-time MBA which ended up being focused on data analytics, since I found I had a passion for it.  After finishing that I quit my job and went to a full-time DS bootcamp. After bootcamp I ended up with three job offers at 3 large consulting firms, but only one was hands on technical data science, so I took it.  I’ve been here for about 4 months and love it.  In my time here I’ve gotten an AWS arch associate cert and Agile certification.  I’m on my first project and am building experience in that regard as well.  

I love learning and I keep going with open courses (not consistently though) but I’ve been wondering about getting more certs or degrees.  I also get about $5K a year from my employer to spend on education (I’m not doing this JUST b/c I have the money…just an aside).  I’ve been thinking of doing an MS in CS, or MS in stats.  Also, I do have an interest in geography and geospatial work so have been looking at MS in those fields as well.  Alternatively, I could just work on more industry certifications like AWS machine learning or Big Data.  I’m wondering if a (part-time) MS CS is worth it for me (I have a BS undergrad in Architectural planning from a top school but it was light on math). 

I’m also wondering, being that I’m a bit late to the game at 40yo, whether going further into a technical, hands on route is my best choice career wise.  It seems like there’s going to be someone younger and better at CS/Stats/Math than me, and that my strengths may lie elsewhere like strategy or management.  

Bottom line is I’m super happy I was able to make this career change into something I really enjoy and have interest in but I also wonder if getting more technical training is my best bet, and if so, should I think about getting another part-time masters.",datascience,1570220607,cragmonster,1,1,True,2019-10-04

Automating and Improving Personal Workflow Help,"I'm a student in a data science bootcamp about half way through. Part of the MO seems to be dumping more work than is possible on us so we're always pushing as hard as possible to get from A to B. This is great but I have limited time and I want to spend the most time on new concepts/tech and learning.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

Tech I'm using:

* Python
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Sklearn
* Jupyter notebooks/lab
* matplotlib

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

**Things I'm looking for: good/common things to automate, utilities that are have super helpful, any lesser known tricks/ideas for improving jupyter workflow.**

Things I've found so far that you might find useful:

* [ipy_table](https://epmoyer.github.io/ipy_table/) - super useful for quickly creating tables. I've used it for making tables comparing accuracy of a neural network as various hyperparameters were tweaked (neuron count, layer count, etc).
* [pandas-profiling](https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling) - quick and awesome EDA tool to run on a dataframe to get descriptive stats on each feature and does quick and dirty correlation matrices to quickly get a handle on a new data set. Can have performance issues for huge DFs.
* [black python formatter](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - I run this a ton. 10/10. I think you either hate this or love it.

&amp;nbsp;

Any general ideas or comments of things I should look at would be helpful! If you happen to have any libraries or git repos of examples, that'd be awesome too!

Sankey Diagram Problem,"*Processing img hrv07bk21pq31...*

I don't really have a DS background, but for my Bachelor Thesis in HCI I want to visualize a privacy policy to show the complex flows and uses of personal data.

But in a quick draft with [sankeymatic.com](http://sankeymatic.com/) I stumbled on a problem:

I don't have only one dimension where everything adds up but I switch from *frequency of personal data being tracked* to *use cases* and finally *third parties receiving data*. This leads to duplicate uses where the amounts don't add up anymore (e.g. Cookie IDs are used by the same trackers for both advertising \[""Werbung"" in german\] and reporting).

How can one train a neural network to classify text into preexisting classifications?," I have a dataset that looks a bit like the following think a shop like walmart. 

[Dataset example](https://i.redd.it/8f5qe0giapq31.png)

This shape of the dataset is quite large with several thousand (maybe &gt;100,000) rows and maybe 50+ columns.

I am wanting to a method in order correctly classify the row based on its description.

So a model based on the above dataset should take a description it has not seen before and correctly classify that item for instance: given the input `iphone 11 $999.99` it should give the output `Electronic, Cell Phone, Apple.`

I am currently only planning on using the description to classify as a first step to keep it simple, however there are other columns such as who supplied the item that could help classify, for instance if the item was supplied by `Apple`  
 or `AT&amp;T`  
 it is more likely to be classified as a `Electronic, Cell Phone,...`  
 for example.

I am thinking to implement a neural network to do this. I have implemented neural network before but only on the typical examples (e.g. a system to identify the numbers 0-9 \[MINST dataset\] or to identify clothes), so I understand the theory of how neural networks work (weights, biases, gradient descent, back propagation etc.) However I am struggling on how to implement this idea I have now.

Here are my thoughts so far:

 

&gt;1. I want to use `Python`, with `tensorflow2.0 + keras`.  
&gt;  
&gt;2. I need a way to convert the text into a numerical format. There seems to be a few options out there like word2vec, but I am not sure what is the best option.  
&gt;  
&gt;3. How many neurons should my base layer have? (With number recognition each image is 28\*28 so a 28\*28 base layer makes a lot of sense, here I am not sure)  
&gt;  
&gt;4. How many hidden layers?  
&gt;  
&gt;5. How many output layers? (Should I have one for each distinct combination of classifications, so one for  
`Electronic, Cell Phone, Samsung`  
, one for `Electronic, Cell Phone, Apple`  
 etc. This would lead to a output layer of thousands of neurons, I am not sure if this is possible/advised?

I am not looking for complete answers, in fact I am aware that it is not really possible given the information provided. Instead I am looking for guidance/suggestions on how to proceed with this problem from someone who is more experienced, perhaps, in fact, most likely there are things I am not considering yet/ other better ways to attack this.",datascience,1570272065,stgy222,1,1,True,2019-10-05

Digital Conversation Analysis,"Hi all!  I am wondering if anyone has a good guide about how to analyze a data set where every row is a timestamped message between two people?

Considering Data Science Career in Future,"Hi everyone, I hope this is the appropriate place to pose this question. A couple of months ago, I mastered out of my physics PhD and am now in the job hunt. A data science career has recently piqued my interest because I love math and computational work in general, and I would love the opportunity to apply those skills to a variety of real world problems. However, aside from functional programming (Python, MATLAB) and some knowledge of regression analysis, I don't really have experience in the field because my background was as an experimental physicist who didn't really deal with high data volumes like high-energy physicists do. I think that showed when I made a final interview round at a company for a data scientist position but ultimately didn't get the job. Therefore, I'm looking for ways to build my skills so I can be better equipped to figure out if this is a field I'd want to pursue and if I can get a job in it.

I know of Andrew Ng's machine learning course on Coursera, which would be a great start since I know nothing about machine learning. What else do people recommend, both in terms of coursework and other things I can do (portfolio building, etc.)? Currently my plan is to find a job that's a strong fit for my skillset and then work towards a data science career transition over the next few years.

Machine learning for data quality control?,"Hi r/MachineLearning

I'll try to keep this reasonably concise.

I work in a data team that does data collection and quality control for a huge array of ocean floats. We collect, process, and manage huge quantities of data (geochemical data, pressure, salinity, etc), ranging from ocean surface to 6km deep. I mainly work in creating software that corrects and adjusts data if we find that an instrument on board a float is misreading consistently or drifting.

I am contracted to work with this team for a year, and then I wanted to return to university to study machine learning. I am by no means massively experienced in this area, my only experience is using some basic ML algorithms in epidemiology (finding force of infection, number if diseases in a population etc), but I really enjoyed it, which is why I wanted to pursue it. The team have decided that they really like me, and want to keep me on after my contract expires, and so have offered to fund an MSc and PhD in machine learning if I complete a project(s) for them whilst at university. I'm happy to do this, as I love atmospheric physics as well as software engineering, so this strikes a very pleasant balance for me.

I need to write a few possible project proposals for my team leader, who will read them over and then talk to professors at potential universities. Problem is, I'm not really experienced enough in ML (yet) to really know what the possibilities are, and I'm pretty new to data science. My team leader is hoping there are applications in automating some of the quality control processes the data scientists here have to do.

Really, I'm just looking for a bit of guidance from the ML community - is there somewhere I should be looking first, or anything that springs to anyone's mind?

This would really mean a lot to me if I managed to get this funding. My background is pretty spot on for machine learning (first class BSc in computer science and statistics, worked as a statistician for a pharmaceutical company, worked as a software engineer for a robotics company, now working for a data company), I just would love to get a formal education in it AND be able to apply it to environmental science. Would be pretty nice to be able to pursue a ML education without putting myself in horrendous debt.

1-2 days to play with model selection and hyperparameter tuning

**I would really appreciate it if you could lend me an opinion as to which one you think would be the best option?**

**Potentially useful context:**

* We are allowed to implement 3rd party packages &amp; libraries
* It would be beneficial if the project has a lot of current material as research is a strong element
* I study NLP, Algorithmic Game Theory, Information Retrieval &amp; Network Security as part of my course
* I want to make something robust (we have to present it to companies &amp; peers)

**1) Kaggle GUI:** An Assistive System for Preparing Entries to Kaggle Machine Learning Competitions

GUI to prep Kaggle competition entries. Basic functions include importing dataset, dividing into training/validation subsets, pre-processing &amp; extracting features using different methods depending on the problem domain, classifying  
the extracted features using at least two classifiers, evaluation by statistical significance test. In addition to a GUI  
for model/parameter settings, results visualising and saving

&amp;#x200B;

**2) Sentiment Analysis :** twitter feed/document positivity etc

**3) Building a real-life 'Recommender system'**

Recommenders are ubiquitous i.e. Amazon, movie review sites. Now it's possible to implement your own recommender and test it on real users e.g. Plista's API  allows you to recommend news articles to millions of users (http://orp.plista.com/documentation). This project is challenging in that it requires a sophisticated recommender system (to perform well against alternative implementations) and solid software engineering (to avoid being kicked out if the response is too slow).

"Choosing my first job in the Data Science field, Any tips?","I just graduated from my master Artificial Intelligence. I have started to send out letters two weeks ago and I already have had several job interviews for data scientist positions. However I feel it's pretty to hard to understand on what kind of level the companies are doing data science. In other words, sometimes data scientist positions are actually for data analyst or a BI expert. Nevertheless I'm at the point where I can choose between three jobs.

One is at a (larger) commercial company (company A). I will mostly do ''data science'' related to customer experience. I already went to two job interviews. The job itself is not bad I guess, but it's more boring I would say than the other two. The plus side is that it's pretty close to my house and they do have options for trainings but not really data science trainings.

One is at a smaller company (company B) that uses satellite imagery and ML to help farmers in Africa. This actually is the most closely related to my expertise. I did an intern for a humanitarian organization where I made a similar model. In other words it's more closely related to my interest. However I do expect I won't be able to learn as much as with company C.

The last company (company C) is a IT consultancy company. I would have lessons each friday with regard to machine learning. 4 days a week I will be working as a IT consultant for this company. Even though it sounds pretty interesting I do wonder how much more I would learn from this training. Since I had the idea (based on the first interview) that the techniques you would learn are far to complex for the problems you would have to solve at the companies you are sent to.

All in all I'm having serious stress these days about choosing and making a decision. I know I should not, but I feel the pressure of choosing pretty bad. Especially since I already have to make a decision about company A. While I have final interviews with company B and C this week.

Could anybody give me some advice or tips for choosing my first job in the Data Science field.

The Long Journey to Data Scientist - Mid Career Switch,"As the title tries to elude to, I am mid career (31 with 8 years of finance experience) without a background in any of the quantitative or computer science knowledge that is a pre-req to become a data scientist. (Undergrad degree in a non-quant finance concentration)

However, after finding the work in corporate finance (FP&amp;A) unappealing (think: monthly reporting routines, manual database/application fixes on back-end processes, and very little actual analysis and insight) I have decided that a career as a data scientist or data statistician may provide the intellectual stimulation and high impact career I am looking for.

However, I havent taken a calc class since I passed my ap calc exam in senior year of high school (~ 14 years ago) and a stats 101 class in my freshmen curriculum in college.  I have no coding or computer science coursework either.  


Considering the above, I have two inquiries:

1. I am unclear as to the % breakdown in responsibilities for a ""typical"" data scientist. I know what I want is a career that more closely resembles the non-stop learning, theorizing, and critical thinking that occurs in college coursework. However, I have heard from another source that over 80% of a data scientists work is cleaning and processing unstructured data. Is that true for all roles in the ""data scientist"" umbrella?


2. What coursework and degree should i go after, considering I have no quantitative background but also know I need the academic rigor to get a data science position that works with far more of the front end theorizing and problem solving framework rather than data cleaning or back end system architecture?

What's the best way to choose which features to use in a model?,"I've playing around with [this Kaggle data set](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview), trying to improve my prediction accuracy. One of the ways I've been doing this is by choosing different features to feed into a model. What I would *like* to do is try every possible combination of features, but that takes too much time (there are over 30 features, so over 2^(30) different combinations I could choose.

I tried doing this anyway, but I can't test much more than 2^(15) combinations on my machine. Regardless, I was able to get decent results. I tried using PCA to get better features to feed into my model, but the results were never as good as with some of the random combinations of raw features I tested. However, I did not spend nearly as much computer time with the PCA method. I just found the principle components choosing different numbers of components (1 - 30). This would take a few seconds to run at most. In the first case I would let my computer run for an hour or more, testing tens of thousands of different combinations of features.

I'm hoping there's a better way to choose features for my model. Any suggestions??

Areas where we've found it useful are biomedical, drone imagery, satellite imagery, retail, and autonomous mobility.

News Recommendation Algorithm idea and implementation,"Hi, 

As I am still learning data science so there may be some mistakes in my implementation/ approach and I highly appreciate your opinions, points, suggestions, modifications.

I am working on a leading financial services company and for their premium users, I need to implement personalized news.

Through I have found out some idea how to approach the problem, I don't know whether my idea is actually the workable solution or not.

**Problem Statement**: Recommend user's news articles.

**Data**: user's personal information such as age, login time, portfolio information, topics that users have high affinity to.  ( this is still WIP still suggestions on data would be beneficial)

&amp;#x200B;

**Solution**: 

Steps

1. ***Finding readers with similar interests:***

As we have mixed data we will be using [hierarchical clustering algorithm using the Gower](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/15313/260511) similarity coefficient.

It will help to group similar users who have similar tastes.

&amp;#x200B;

**2.** ***Topic modeling***

 To understand news articles we will use the [LDA algorithm](https://blog.insightdatascience.com/news4u-recommend-stories-based-on-collaborative-reader-behavior-9b049b6724c4) to identify topics in news.

 We can also use it to understand how much a news article is relevant to the topic.

 To identify the diversity of topics I will use Jaccard similarity. as we do not want many topics and similar topics.

&amp;#x200B;

For mapping news with users, we will use the number of clicks of the user on particular news containing the topic.

&amp;#x200B;

**3.** ***Recommendation***

As we have a Group of clusters which has information about their affinity toward the topic, 

we can find out similar news article which is similar to the topic using [cosine similarity](https://www.machinelearningplus.com/nlp/cosine-similarity/) and recommend that article to the user group.

Seeking career advice," Hi all, I have been working at a start up for over a year as a data scientist. 

Like with any startup, it has its problems. But like any hype around AI, everyone thinks everything can be done. 

When I first started, there was no training whatsoever. The problem is not only with poor management but also poor collection of data. Since start of the year, company has wanted to venture into NLP (and computer vision), but to date after going rounds in circles we only have limited number of documents to work with. They don't have an exact procedure of doing things, and with limited data its also equally hard for me to do things. 

Sometimes they change objectives extremely fast. Today I could be working on some computer vision problems, next week they could be asking me how far we are into it. The following week they might think we are wasting time and change their objectives. Either they have no concept that each problem is not trivial or I am dumb… 

Each time I change to work on a different problem, I have to switch context which is taxing on its own. This has happened many times. They are eager to launch a product sure, but without thinking if first of all the problem has a good solution. 

Its reaching a breaking point for me as I feel I am getting nowhere with my career. Can anyone tell me how to deal with it? I am not sure if its weakness on my part that these are common occurrences in startups data science job or not. I am thinking of leaving and have X months saved up so financially wise its not too big of an issue though if i stay unemployed too long It does. For context, I have a masters in statistics as well if that helps.

"The term data scientist is so loosely defined by various companies, and that is one reason(not the only reason) why there are an absurd number of job seekers.","At some companies, data scientist is a person who creates monthly counts of customers and never works with machine learning. Even though the title is data scientist, this really should be a business or data analyst. 

At other companies, a data scientist is a person who builds data pipelines along with data analysis reports even though that should be a data engineer. 

And at other companies, a data scientist is someone who reads academic papers and writes software to translate those papers into software production code that is used by other teams. This should be a machine learning engineer but companies define it as data scientist. 

This along with the large number of data science graduates every year is creating a huge supply of people who call themselves data scientists.

Seguing From Data Science To Data Engineering or ML Engineering?,"Anyone got any tips on transitioning to either Data Engineering or ML Engineering?  I need to work remotely due to disability, and it seems like there's just A LOT more engineering positions than Data Scientist positions (especially ones that are okay with being 100% remote from day 1).

Have about a decade of experience in some-version-of-Data-Science (counting my first role which was using SPSS in a lab in undergrad).  Undergrad gave me a strong stats background, but I'm self-taught with coding.  I've been doing Python data science for about 6 years now, and I think I'm pretty good at Data Scientist Code Practices (packaging things into neat &amp; tidy functions, descriptive names, even fallen in love with Type Annotations), and am very good with pandas &amp; friends, and SQL (or at least the retrieval side).  

Buut I don't really have much Proper Software Engineering experience - I've written simple pipelines for clients (one's running to this day, and it emails me every day about it =D ) but it was always kind of ad-hoc.  I never really learned proper stuff about Testing, or even what else I don't know that maybe I'd need to.  I also find it kind of panic-inducing to touch live infrastructure, but hopefully I'd get used to that  =D  I do know my way conceptually around the different AWS &amp; GCP services, though.

I do like the Data Science part best, but honestly I legitimately enjoy designing data cleaning schemes too.  I wouldn't necessarily mind if that was my primary duty.  From what I've read about what ML Engineers do, sounds like I wouldn't necessarily mind that either (at least the parts that were familiar - setting up scripts to retrain models and serve up predictions and such).  Plus, again, seems like there's just a lot more work out there (especially remote) for these than for Data Science.

Any tips or resources to recommend for either?  Most of the things I found seem to assume that you're a Software Engineer, haven't really found anything that's aimed at people who are starting from the Data Science side.  

Also, any advice as to which might be easier or more fun or just overall better move from Data Science?  Or just any stories to share from/about people who have made that move?

Other assorted questions: 

1. What, if anything, should I know about Java?  I find those Spark stacktraces to be kind of terrifying - as a proper Data Engineer, would I imagine they'd come up a lot? 
2. Should I pick up Scala?  For one?  For either?  PySpark always seemed a little behind.  I do like Functional Programming a lot - I picked up Clojure on a whim a few years back, and I basically write Python as Functional as possible.

On Data And Science,"&amp;#x200B;

[Illustration by Héizel Vázquez](https://i.redd.it/j3muwic0rmr31.png)

Data science is the main focus of most sciences and studies right now, it needs a lot of things like AI, programming, statistics, business understanding, effective presentations skills and much more. That’s why it’s not easy to understand or study. But we can do it, we are doing it. 

Data science has become the standard solving problem framework for the academia and the industry and it’s going to be like that for a while. But we need to remember where we are coming from, who we are and where we are going.  

In this article I start with a series of studies and comments I'm making about the history of our field and how it would help us understand what we do.

&gt;How many yards will an NFL player gain after receiving a handoff?  
American football is a complex sport. From the 22 players on the field to specific characteristics that ebb and flow throughout the game, it can be challenging to quantify the value of specific plays and actions within a play. Fundamentally, the goal of football is for the offense to run (rush) or throw (pass) the ball to gain yards, moving towards, then across, the opposing team’s side of the field in order to score. And the goal of the defense is to prevent the offensive team from scoring.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;In the National Football League (NFL), roughly a third of teams’ offensive yardage comes from run plays.. Ball carriers are generally assigned the most credit for these plays, but their teammates (by way of blocking), coach (by way of play call), and the opposing defense also play a critical role. Traditional metrics such as ‘yards per carry’ or ‘total rushing yards’ can be flawed; in this competition, the NFL aims to provide better context into what contributes to a successful run play.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;As an “armchair quarterback” watching the game, you may think you can predict the result of a play when a ball carrier takes the handoff - but what does the data say? In this competition, you will develop a model to predict how many yards a team will gain on given rushing plays as they happen. You'll be provided game, play, and player-level data, including the position and speed of players as provided in the NFL’s Next Gen Stats data. And the best part - you can see how your model performs from your living room, as the leaderboard will be updated week after week on the current season’s game data as it plays out.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Deeper insight into rushing plays will help teams, media, and fans better understand the skill of players and the strategies of coaches. It will also assist the NFL and its teams evaluate the ball carrier, his teammates, his coach, and the opposing defense, in order to make adjustments as necessary.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Additionally, the winning model will be provided to the NFL’s Next Gen Stats group to potentially share with teams. You could help the NFL Network generate models to use during games, or for pre-game/post-game breakdowns.",datascience,1570706800,mystikaldanger,0,1,True,2019-10-10

Data science team model - experimental and support,"Hi

I’m looking for some insights around how should we organise a data science team.

Currently our team is still at its infancy, founded exclusively to support our parent business companies which have multiple portfolios in different industries.

Portfolio example would be healthcare and fast moving consumer goods.

The data science team is responsible to pitch data science use cases for the business units.

If the business sees potential, the team is then responsible to implement a POC to demonstrate value. Typically the POC culminates into an interactive Power BI dashboard for the business users to consume.

Our main concern moving forward is, after we have a few successful data science products, how should we structure the team such that we can 
1. Implement POCs
2. Support productionalized data science products (enhancement and maintenance)

Task number 1 of implementing POCs still remains the team’s objective.

But at the same time, the current team structure is not ready to do both - implement new POCs and also do continuous IT support for productionalized products.

I’d be appreciative to know how others are organising their data science team between creative experimentation &amp; also continuous product enhancements and supports.

Trouble getting a(n) (DS) internship.,"As a DS undergrad I really do regret choosing DS major. It feels like you're a jack of all traits, master of none. I have been applying to internships and of the few times I do get through to the interview stage I noticed the problem with a DS undergrad program.

1. No one wants a Data Science undergrad intern. They want people with at least a MSc or PhD for DS intern roles since it's so math/stats/research/ML heavy and undergrads don't have that level of understanding of those subjects. Very few companies have DS internships for undergrads.
2. Companies would rather have Statistics/Math/CS students fill the DS intern roles than actual DS students since most of them know at least one useful language/software (R/Python/MATLAB). Stats/Math undergrads have much stronger foundation in Stats/Math and CS are much better at writing solid algo's w/ better design.
3. Final and most important point: DS undergrads are jack of all traits, Master of NONE. I applied to SWE roles (which I did mostly self study for), quant trader/researcher and few DS roles. I did notice the huge disparity in SWE skills and advanced stats skills I'm missing. My first interview I totally bombed because I though as a decent DS student with 3.5+ GPA I should be able to solve simple stats/CS question, but most of the questions asked weren't even part of my curriculum.

In hindsight I wouldn't choose DS major again and I'm really disappointed how useless it feels. I would have much rather went the CS/Stats/Math major route with some DS courses on the side.

Where do you draw the line? For data cleaning/deleting entries,"I'm working with a dataset that measures how much time users spend online per \*day\*. There were a number of entries that exceeded 50,000 minutes which I deleted straightaway, because there's literally not enough minutes in a data for that to be possible. But there's also instances in which users supposedly spent 600-800 minutes in 1 day. That seems excessive to me? Here's a simple distribution plot I arrived at.

https://i.redd.it/cpzvutkf8yr31.png

My question is, where would you draw the line? I know there are some people who spend upwards of 10 hours online, so I'm inclined to keep those values even though the distribution looks \*insanely\* skewed.

Berkeley MIDS v.s. GT OMSA,"I recently got accepted by Berkeley program, and waiting for OMSA’s decision. Hypothetically, if I get into OMSA program as well, which program is a better choice in term of overall value and long term career goal ?  


Background : 5-7 years Business Analyst experiences. Hold MA in other field in foreign country. Berkeley or GT will be my first and only relevant degree. Work as consultant in one of FLAG company, would like to keep BA or DS tract for long term career.   


Here is my thought about Berkeley v.s. GT

1. Both curriculum are good fit for me.
2. I based in Bay Area for now and plan to stay for another 5-10 years. Aluminum Network from Berkeley will be better than GT.
3. GT OMSA program has solid and friendly community, easy to ask questions and help. 
4. Berkeley program cost $60-70K, and GT cost only $10K. 
5. No company’s tuition aid for now, but plan to get some. (For example, change company)

Easier to land Software Eng or DS position at Big N with prior image processing/DL experience?,"I have an MS and used C++ for my thesis in a STEM, but non-CS field a few years ago. Since then, I worked on Data Science/Machine Learning freelance roles for a few months, and I've been at my current job for nearly 2 years. In this role, I've spent the majority of the time working on image processing, but I also spent a couple months using C++ and about 3-4 months using Python for deep learning for tasks such as image denoising, GANs, and semantic segmentation

I was thinking I should seek new opportunities because even though I get to work remotely, this is a contract role ending in a few months and it may not renew or I may not get converted to full-time. I didn't even get a raise after the first year

I thought I would have the best chances at jobs requiring experience with image processing and deep learning. However, I don't have a PhD or publications, so from what I've gathered, I wouldn't have a chance at DL jobs using Python. I prefer to work at a larger company, so from what I've gathered, Software Engineer positions are more within my reach

Another problem is that I have alot of gaps in my resume, so I also figured I wouldn't have a chance at Software Engineer roles at Big N.

Job prospects in Japan for a beginner?,"Hi everyone,  
  
My goal is to move to Japan to be with my fiancee in the next 1.5 - 2 yrs or so. If that can't be done then at least to the west coast (USA) where timezones are closer and flights are cheaper. That being said, I thought getting into a data science career (either in Japan or the west coast) would be perfect given my background and interests.  
  
I graduated from college back in 2014 with a degree in chemical engineering and physics. Afterwards, I continued on to grad school for my PhD in Computational Biophysics, thinking I wanted to be a professor one day. Lo and behold, I abandoned that dream and withdrew during my third year to explore medicine a bit. Nevertheless, my research experiences were pretty much all computational simulations that dealt with a lot of data manipulation/analysis, and I enjoyed that portion. I don't have a formal education in Data Science or Comp Sci, but my engineering and physics background has given me a solid quantitative/statistical/coding foundation.
  
Now that I actually need a stable career to support myself and my fiancee in the near future, I wanted to leverage my STEM-heavy background and jump into a data science career, whether that be in Japan or somewhere in the west coast.   
  
How should I spend the next year to make myself a desirable job applicant?   
  
I'm currently taking the IBM Data Science Certification course on Coursera to get myself started, but I'm not sure where to go from there other than starting my own projects and putting them onto Github. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

I'm working on the example in this link https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/predicting-employee-churn-python and had a big question that I can't seem to find the answer for.

I understand most of the process outlined in this article but was wondering what approach I should take if I am attempting to predict for future churn within the employees that are still at the company. 

Is there a ""proper"" way to do this? Do I just look at the prediction probabilities of those close to the threshold between churn and no churn? Are false positives (assuming 1 = churn), employees that are still with the company and likely to leave?
 Or is there no way of predicting future churn within the dataset?

If programming languages were human languages which one would be which?,"Most developers know (or get to know quickly once they join a team or publish some piece of work) that  programming languages are as much about communicating with other developers as they are about instructing the computer. Which raises the  interesting question: **If programming languages were human languages which one would be which?** Here is a (*tonque-in-cheek mind you!*)  compilation of a mapping between programming languages and human  languages

 

* **python -&gt; English**. Simple and easy. Spoken  everywhere (but not everybody speaks it to native speaker standard!)  From lowly scripts, to web servers to #datascience, you’re never  stranded if you know it. 
* **rlang -&gt; German**. Capable. Focused. Sometimes a bit convoluted. Not spoken much outside the Germanic world though. 
* **julia -&gt; Dutch**, a quirky small language the claims to combine the best of various worlds. Its speakers are particularly proud :-)
* **java -&gt; Latin**. Was *lingua franca* for a looong time but recently the empire is losing some lustre. Well structured. Solid but awkwardly verbose. 
* **kotlin -&gt; Italian** Modern reincarnation of Latin. Claims to be all the good pieces of Java with none of the verbiage. 
* **C/C++ -&gt; French**. Elaborate. Fully fledged.  Generally underestimated despite its major contributions. Many words of  English are actually French, just like many python libraries are  actually C/C++. Now tries to reinvent itself once again to remain  relevant
* **rust -&gt; Finnish** Wants to come out of nowhere and conquer the world by sheer coolness (like the frozen North). 
* **javascript -&gt; Chinese**. Spoken by very large  numbers but until recently confined to the geography of the browser.  Increasingly seen outside it’s former borders though, through server  side node.js
* **golang -&gt; Spanish**. The preferred language of a rapidly growing empire. Challenges old world boundaries
* **php -&gt; Indian**. Completely dominating the web sub-continent but some argue it is a collage of very popular frameworks  rather than a single language
* **haskell -&gt; Japanese**. Pure Zen
* **fortran -&gt; Greek.** Ancient roots. Provided the  words to many newer languages. Today rather niche but still an excellent  way to express mathematical tasks
* **lisp -&gt; Russian**. Besides profound and  mysterious, unlike most other languages lisp makes no distinction  between expressions and statements (Reminds of the conflation between a/the articles in Russian)

Tips on communicating data science effectiveness to non-technical stakeholders?,"I recently (5 months ago) started a position at a mostly non-technical company, and was hired with the explicit purpose of instantiating data science practices within the organization. The problem I'm constantly running in to is that I don't know how to effectively communicate the business impact of a certain project to my boss and other EXTREMELY non technical stakeholders, which means that the project gets rejected before it gets off the ground. As an example, my organization currently has no method of tracking who wants to be involved in our business, who stays involved, and who leaves, something I'm sure I don't need to communicate the value of here. The only data we are currently really collecting is about our current member base, and is updated by hand using excel sheets that are sent around the country. 

Do you guys have any advice for how I can better sell these data science type projects to my bosses? It feels like I'm maybe not understanding what the business impact they're looking for is as well. What experience do you guys have with this type of thing? As far as the project I mentioned above (tracking interest in our org) it ended up being rejected because there is ""no need or use for anything of the sort."" Is this something I should try pushing my boss on, or should I wait for newer projects to come along and use them as examples of business effectiveness?

It really feels like my direct boss read a Forbes article on data science and decided that's what the organization needs.

Keep getting rejected because of my lack of CS experience,"So I’ve made it to the in-person stage for 3 data science positions recently, and got the same feedback each time —they are looking for someone with a stronger background in computer science.

What I find confusing and frustrating is that each of these interview processes included a programming challenge in SQL and Python, so my skill level wasn’t exactly a secret-and I still got called in for an in-person interview in each case. I got my masters in statistics with a concentration in data science, so my resume doesn’t mention a computer science background anywhere —neither did the job postings, for that matter.

In each case I asked the recruiter for more details on what they were looking for, since CS is obviously a huge field.  Were they looking for someone with more knowledge about data structures / algorithms?  A programming language that I am unfamiliar with?  I never got a clear answer on what exactly they wanted in a candidate, so I’m a bit lost.  Should I be pursuing a second master’s degree, or is it enough to simply improve my python / SQL skills?

"To data scientist: ""I think data engineering is quite tough!""","No seriously; I'm doing an MSc in DS right now (on my project dissertation phase) and I'm having some tough time tabulating my data even! Though admittedly it's still in the beginning phase of data analysis, I can see how this can be difficult (e.g. time consuming) even in the industry.

e.g.:

I've extracted and got all my data, so I thought data engineering would be ""cake walk"" and I just need to feed my data to some model and do ""data science"" afterwards lol. But after carefully ""looking"" at a more detailed view of my data, I just found out one of my data sources has duplicated dates but different times (e.g. 01/01/2017 00:00:10 and 01/01/2017 00:10:10), where as the other data source that I'd be comparing this with has a continuous unique date interval with no time on it. I went blank for awhile with no idea what to do with these inconsistencies but finally figured out I can just get the average from the duplicates and continue doing the comparison with the other data source.

But then of course comes the other data engineering part where I need to write some scripts or even some excel commands to ensure this is happening properly. I also got a few bunch of errors just now where the average is not computing because the data type of one of the columns cannot be counted for some reason ...

Jesus ... and that's one scenario! I can't image the complexity of this in the industry. Do other data scientist feel the same? As in data engineering is quite tough?",datascience,1567126529,runnersgo,22,4,True,2019-08-29

MS Data Science/Stats - few questions,"Hello,  I'm currently about to start senior year of my undergrad and am  seriously interested in completing a MS in Statistics afterwards. I was  leaning towards a Data Science program but I would not mind doing an  Applied Stats track. I had a few questions regarding my situation.

My  undergrad stats at the moment are: 3.0 gpa(can probably raise to  3.2-3.3 by the end of senior year), GRE score: 156V/161Q/waiting for  essays to be graded, 2 internships (1 software engineering + 1 machine  learning), I don't have any recommendation letters at the moment but I'm  confident I can get a few once I go back to college. My degree is a B.S  in Computer Science and a minor in Statistics.

My questions(sorry there's a few):

What  range of schools should I apply to? Ignoring factors such as  money/location I would like to know where I stand. I think my situation  is different because my stats are on the low side but I do have some  work experience.

I started the  Statistics minor only last year so my transcript only shows that I have  completed Stats I-II and Probability. I am taking higher leveled and  more detailed electives this year such as Regression etc. Will colleges  see my full transcript including senior year classes/grades before they  make a decision about my application? I am really worried about this  because I want them to see my completion of higher level electives. I  also would prefer them to see my gpa at the end of senior year. Is the  only way this can be possible is if I apply 1 year later, so after I  graduate?

Should I take Calc 3?  (Multivariable) The B.S in Computer science at my program only required  up to calc 2 and linear which I have completed, should I try to fit in  Calc 3 in my schedule before graduating? Would Calc 3 be required even  for a Data Science track? I know it most likely is for all Applied Stats  programs.

Should I retake the GRE  and try to do better on the quantitative? I was scoring 164+ on  practice tests but was a little anxious during the actual test. I think I  would have to retake it pretty soon in order to meet the application  deadlines to start a MS next year which might be an issue since I will  also have a lot of college work. I guess I wouldn't mind working for  some time after graduating and retaking it later when I have more free  time.

Advice on managing messy data features,"This is more on data engineering but I am hopeful the folks on this sub can help me out with this; imagine several features are extracted **from some table:**

* *Amount 5Y*
* *Amount 5Y (10%)*
* *Amount Diff*
* *Approx. Savings*
* *AS - House Loan*

I think the folks here can tell that this table is storing some sort of financial values within some years (hint *5Y* as *5 years*).

But I think ... the information or features stored here are just ... urm ... **terribly messy?** (this table contains monthly savings of a citizen for 5 years; the citizen has job X which is paid Y salary; the citizen is assumed to be single with a house loan and some assumed expenses):

**Let's dissect them:**

|*Feature*|Elaboration|
|:-|:-|
|*Amount 5Y*|Net amount saved annually for 5 years|
|*Amount 5Y (10%)*|Basically the first feature but if there's a 10% salary increase within that 5 years|
|*Amount Diff (%)*|The difference between the first two features|
|*Approx. Savings*|First or second feature minus whatever expenses the person has|
|*AS - House Loan*|4th feature minus loan|

So, if you're somewhat confused with the features' elaboration; great, so am I and these are not even 10% of the actual features extracted from the table ... ; if you're not, great as well, but is there a way to improve them?

a) Retrain the model on 100% of the data without touching any of the hyperparameters and then deploy it.

**Background**

I graduated with a degree in Finance 5 years ago and have been working as an analyst in finance-related institutions (Banks, investment holding companies, etc.). My main responsibilities included analysis, report generation and analysis using Microsoft Excel. Recently, I moved to an operations role (as an analyst) in a logistics company. The job requirements are broadly similar, but my department is expanding towards data analytics. Coming from literally 0 programming knowledge, I researched online and Python seems to be one of the more popular programming languages used for data analytics.

___
**Readings &amp; Practicing**

I started learning the basic of Pythons with [Coursera's Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python). This gave me a fundamental understanding of Python and it's capabilities. 

Upon completion, I started viewing Corey Schafer's videos on YouTube. I have also enrolled in edx's [MIT's Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:MITx+6.00.1x+2T2019a/course/) which started this week.

After speaking to my manager, he recommended me to first understand the fundamentals behind data science and understand the scientific approaches to learning from data and using it to tell the story. 

To start off he recommended Coursera's course on [Basic statistics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/basic-statistics). After which, he recommended me to combine what I've learnt and embark on [Statistics with Python](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics-with-python).

All of this is overwhelming as I find myself jumping back and forth between learning Python and Statistics. If I were to focus on Statistics, how in-depth (Advanced Statistics?) do I have to go before embarking on Python?

"Feeling understimulated in my graduate role at a large bank, is this common?","Hi all,

Recently graduated and found a great graduate job at a relatively high profile bank. I was initially nervous as hell going into work on day 1 because I really wanted to give my best and tackle challenges but it's been a very chill couple of weeks so far. The role I applied for is within Data Analytics (Graduate) and I feel like a good part of the reason why I got the role is because of my previous data science intern/contract role where I actually helped out with Python/R coding in relation to machine learning and predictive modelling. At the bank right now, everything is so slow paced and there is barely any predictive/ML modelling at all, the only coding being automation and churning out graphs using ggplot2.

Is this normal?

I'm thinking of maybe just doing side projects in my spare time to keep up with my interest in modelling because currently, all I can see happening within my team of 8 is basic SQL queries and R scripts that slice/dice Excel spreadsheets.",datascience,1567318464,Nut_Flush,17,16,True,2019-09-01

So IS this accepatable for ARIMA or should I further difference it ?

What’s using a supercomputer actually like? Eg what’s the UI like, do I effectively connect my computer to it or will it be like using a terminal? What skills do I need to know before using it? I haven’t found anything online about this so any insight or experience is appreciated.

How to change careers?,"I've posted here a few times before about wanting to get into the data science field. I'm a Mechanical Engineer with 2 years of experience in 2 entirely different realms of engineering. I'm miserable. My current job pays extremely well, with great benefits, etc. But I am miserable. There is almost no technical aspect to it, and it is nearly entirely administrative in nature. I'm bored to death every day, plus I have quite a long commute each way.

My first job had a one time programming/data analysis project and I fell in love. I have since taken online courses in python and more recently SQL to further my skillset. I reached out to a local internet startup senior data scientist and explained my predicament. He then sent me an analyst assessment, which I enjoyed working on and completed... and just got back to me saying he thinks I would be a good fit in their summer internship program next year.

There is no way I could financially afford to leave my current job for an internship. I had such a good feeling about that assessment, that I just feel absolutely depleted right now. Worthless even.

"How to know a time series is stationary, Especially when it comes to variance?","I am learning ARIMA where I came across differencing (d) where you have to determine 'd' depending upon if the time series stationary. From what I have learnt from that is the mean and variance have to constant. I got the mean part but not the variance . 

Take this for example : I got this learning form Mike Crowson YouTube video on ARIMA modelling on SPSS.

[A simple time series plot of 20 observation dataset with two variables : week and quality \(of computer products\) ](https://i.redd.it/mr8mwxamydk31.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

[A differencing of one is done to make the mean constant but variance is not \(atleast as stated in the paper\)](https://i.redd.it/do6rrvfbzdk31.jpg)

What the paper says :

""The series now appears stationary with respect to central tendency, so second differencing does

not appear necessary. However, the variability seems to be increasing over time. Transformation is

considered for series in which variance changes over time and differencing does not stabilize the

variance (cf. Box et al., 1994; McCleary &amp; Hay, 1980). The logarithmic transformation is appropriate.

Because of the zero and negative values in qual\_1, with -11 the largest negative value, 12, is

added before computing the log .""

[And now the series is stationarised i.e. the variance is also constant.](https://i.redd.it/mn3pp7uwzdk31.jpg)

The paper continues :

""The transformed difference is plotted to see if both mean and variance are now stabilized, as

seen in the figure.

Although the scale has changed, the transformed difference does not appear to have less variability

than the untransformed difference. There is also the usual problem of increased difficulty of

interpretation of transformed variables. Therefore, the untransformed difference is used in future

analyses.""

But I honestly don't see the difference . So my question is essentially how do you know the variance is not constant ? Also do I have to use Log Transform only when the variance is not constant.",datascience,1567521095,vigbig,3,0,True,2019-09-03

Approach to correlation when the meat of the data is categorical,"Hi everyone, I have been going back and forward with this data set and being isolated and not having anyone to bounce back ideas with is making it harder.

I ended up merging this data set with the open PLUTO datasets regarding that region to add some information regarding the building features hoping to find a connection between the building features and the complaints I see.

My DS supervisor bailed on me ... would a normal CS supervisor be sufficient?,"DS postgrad supervisor bailed on me - she said she's needed to do X, Y and Z so she can no longer supervise the PG students. 

I wasn't upset or anything since the project was just 10% completed but I chose her simply because her works are on the specific DS field I'm working on (e.g. DS predictive models).

I do have other DS supervisor but they are either working on some other things (e.g. visualisation and interactivity), or they are basically purely CS supervisor (not necessarily working on DS or working on hybrid DS works e.g. Security on Big Data).

So my choices are now:

1. DS supervisor that's working on other unrelated fields
2. CS supervisor that's working on hybrid DS + CS fields
3. CS supervisor that's not working on DS

I really don't have much of a choice but I'd like to minimise any risks that I may not be able to foresee - frankly, I'm a bit delusional right now since I didn't expect the DS supervisor to bail on me : /

My questions:

1. Suppose my only option is (2) or (3) for some reason, would a normal CS supervisor be sufficient?
2. Would it matter to just work with (1)?

I define working on data science task by working on the entire process, collecting the data, analysing it, cleansing, trying to find potential in it, decide how to use it to solve a particular problem, building the model, train it, test it, keep improving it, and then produce a ready-to-use model.

I don't know how much I would learn in the position mentioned above, and how much I will waste time working on other kinds of tasks rather than on speciallized data science tasks. For that I have two questions:

Formal or Informal Data Science education for this Data Analyst?,"To start, yes, I read the ' **Want to pursue career in Data Science, need advice**' thread linked in the FAQ.

Hello everyone, 

After 10+ years of working for the same company, I've creeped my title up to 'Manager of Data Analysis'. The pay is already overlapping to that of a Data Scientist but in actuality, my technical knowledge beyond Tableau (certified), scripting, and Advanced SQL is minimal (basically, I'm overpaid, slightly underskilled). I know that leaving this company will come with a drastic pay decrease so I want to get my golden parachute ready - especially if the market takes a hit in the near future.

I'm well aware that my potential salary won't increase much after graduation (probably $20k increase). I'd prefer to continue working for this company but the Data Scientist positions open here require a Masters and an intimidating knowledge base. **My question is,** is it better to do self-study and boost my skill set on my own, or take the formal route and ascertain a solid education and long-term credibility in the market?

I am starting to collect and analyze some medical claims data for my new project and thinking about which methods could be appropriate for inference purposes. 

The main idea is to look at these claims and find factors/variables/events that lead to an event of observation stay as a follow up for your hospital stay/outpatient procedure/or other medical procedures. 

The problem is that some people have only one medical claim, and some may have more than one claim. At first I thought about simply using logistic regression for inference purposes, but not I am not so sure because I think that the assumption of independence might be violated here.

What do you think are these residuals the sign the model is not performing well?  If so, what can I do to improve the model performance.

They all seem to have a chapter about ""Forschungsinstrument"" which I translated to research instrument and I hope I'm correct about that. Most of them have a ""questionaire"" as instrument and are writing about how they put it together and what you have to be aware of when creating a questionaire and citing sources on the topic of questionaires. I'm now not sure if I should say that my instrument was an exam. I'm not even sure if this is valid. It's not really a questionaire either because it is built entirely different. I'm having trouble reading up on it too because the only source I could finde was an article from 1951 ""Tests as research instrument"" and I don't understand much of this guy is trying to say.",datascience,1567727177,QuimiQ,3,1,True,2019-09-05
Data Analysts - How to manage position with little to no direction?,"I'm a bit over 2 years out of school with experience as a Data Analyst. I started a job as a data analyst for a cleaning company that services a big 4 tech company (on site, fully dedicated to 1 client right now)  and have been there for a few months now. When I was hired, I was told to just ""improve our technology platform"" because that was the main complaint from the client about the account. I'll add that due to the nature of the industry, I'm pretty much the only developer in the entire company. 

from the start, the instructions were really vague and direction was only ever just ""make it better"". I started by identifying weakness in current processes, and trying to automate things. At this point, I've moved the whole reporting stuff over from manual spreadsheets to SQL and airflow and an automated system, which has been pretty successful.

However, at this point, I've reached a few snags that I'm not sure what to do about. First, I've realized that no-one really cares or uses what I've built (dashboards have like 1 view every 2 weeks), despite getting overwhelmingly positive feedback. Second, any and all analysis that I could potentially do is limited by non-existent data - where the only way to get it would be through people entering stuff through forms. I've brought this up with some of the team, but they have some resistance due to the tedious nature of forms.

At this point, I'm honestly what sure I'm supposed to do. Nobody has complained about any of my work, but at the same time nobody comes to me asking me for analysis or anything either. 

I just wanted to reach out to Reddit and see if there were any other solo developers / analysts that had similar experiences and to see how you handled it. (or advice)

Am I too slow or the expectations my manager has are unrealistic?,"I work at a marketing firm as a data analyst who sometimes does machine learning. Very hesitantly I call myself a data scientist, for the lack of a better word. That term is used very loosely these days. Anyways.

The work is typically like doing some EDA, running simulations for loyalty programs, doing some regression analysis, sometimes doing segmentation on customers using basic SQL/Pandas queries (occasionally using ML techniques), coming up with algorithms for lead scoring, etc.

I have to constantly switch between requirements, tasks are assigned verbally or over email, there's no tracking system in place.

The people I have to deal with don't seem to appreciate that it takes time and effort to write code, generate insights, verify the results, present them in a format that non-tech sales people will understand. Besides, as in any analytics/ML project, the first approach we try seldom works. Data science is as much an iterative process as software development is IMHO. Not to mention that data is never available in a clean format. I have to spend a lot of time cleaning it before I can use it for producing results.

Usually, I get a problem statement at time t, and at t+24 hours, I'm asked for results. I find this difficult to cope with. I come from a software engineering background, where I was used to working on one problem at a time. Nobody expects daily deliverables in a software dev job (at least at no good company again IMHO). Because quality work takes time. There are times when you just don't hit your zone and get stuck at seemingly trivial problems. You need breaks, you need time to relax.

My company doesn't seem to understand this. They are mostly sales/business people who just expect ""decks"" (powerpoint presentations). They have no idea what kind of effort goes into real data science projects.

I have tried to discuss this with my manager that the deadlines are too near and too frequent. Data analytics is not a one day job. But he thinks I have a very pessimistic attitude. I was aghast after hearing that from him.

Am I just too slow for my job? I'm seriously contemplating switching to a new company. I'd like to know what kind of deadlines you guys have at work.",datascience,1567787469,newplayer12345,61,146,True,2019-09-06

Mid career advice for an ML generalist?,"I’ve been working as a data scientist / ml engineer for around 6 years now (post math PhD) and I’m a bit stuck as to where to go next.

Brief summary of my experience:

* 6 months internship data scientist at a startup
* 4 years data analyst/data scientist at a mid size tech company
* 1 year machine learning team lead at a startup
* 1 year backend engineer at a recently acquired and now large tech company which I’m trying to get out of

Problem is, my experience is a bit scattered and my career goals are to maximise my salary before the tech bubble bursts lol.

* my engineering experience is only “level 4” by big tech standards due to lack of large scale cross-team projects, (which is hard on my ego due to the fact that I’m quite a bit older thanks to grad school)
* I don’t have enough leadership experience for most manager jobs (and I’m not sure I want to be a pure manager)
* I can’t get a senior DS job since I seem to always fumble stats questions, maybe due to never studying it formally ... I know I can work things out as I need them, but I don’t know what the “right” answers are in interviews. 

My favourite job by far was at the startup which was a great mix of management, DS and engineering, so part of me just wants to try and find another good startup. But I also want to invest wisely in my career.

`aggl.clust.c &lt;- hclust(gower.dist, method = ""complete"")`

3) I find the optimal amount of clusters via silhouette method.

I would like to check other clustering techniques out. Keep in mind that the features are mainly factors so k-mean-like techniques woulds be underperforming if not impossible at all to apply.

Any suggestions/sources I would need to check out?

Brutal Truth Needed!,"A quick summary - I was a depressed and directionless underachiever from my mid teens through to my mid twenties. At the age of 26, I returned to education to study a BSc and MSci in Natural Sciences here in the UK. I did very well, was awarded a undergraduate research scholarship, and ultimately graduated with a 1st Class honours, and top of my cohort.

This led to several funded PhD offers in computational physics. I accepted one at a top London university, with a professor that was very well known in his (admittedly obscure, no practical application) field. Unfortunately, things didn’t go as planned (death of a close family member, disillusionment, crippling imposter syndrome), and I decided to submit as an MPhil rather than continue to PhD. Sat my viva, got through corrections, graduated in Dec 2018. 

During that time, I also built my own small business in a non-tech field. We learned a lot, and we get by (just about). But it isn’t sustainable as a career, and I genuinely don’t enjoy the work. I’ve been learning DS in my spare time over the last few months, and I’m so happy to be working on something that challenges and stimulates me again! I even managed to get some interviews for DS positions. But I fell at the last hurdle when they realised that my skills aren’t up to scratch. 

So, here’s my question - this is mainly directed at the more experienced among you, and those involved in hiring. I’m very seriously considering investing a lot of time and money into one of the better known DS bootcamps. Given my background, and the fact that I’ll be competing with hordes of equally, and more, skilled people 10 years my junior... am I in with a chance in today’s saturated market, post bootcamp? 

Im now in my mid-30’s, and it really does feel like my last chance at anything resembling a career. Prior to returning to education, I worked a string of dead-end jobs in call centres and restaurants, and my business is food-related, with extremely limited prospects. So, I’m willing to take the gamble and throw myself 100% into it. But that last thing I want is to be in the same position, with 1000’s in debt hanging over me...",datascience,1567921856,leetauri,30,4,True,2019-09-08

3. Would anyone be interested in learning more or participating in our beta?

# The Partner Launch Program

At Gravity AI, we understand how difficult it can be for data scientists with valuable IP to package and sell their technology to big companies. We simplify this process by containerizing your algorithm, then adding a security layer that’s often required by enterprise IT, and finally making your algorithm available to enterprise through a simple web interface. 

As we prepare for public launch, we are inviting data scientists like you to work with us in a few ways. The marketplace is ready to begin seeding algorithms, and we are actively building a select group of First Sellers, who have algorithms they own and would like to sell. We are also adding Curators, who can help us find and assess open-source algorithms to package for the enterprise. Lastly, we are expanding our team with data scientists who are willing to work part-time.

| | FIRST SELLERS|GRAVITY CURATOR|PART-TIME |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| What is it? |Opportunity for data scientists who have developed and own algorithm(s) they want to sell to enterprise clients on our platform. | We’re searching for algorithms that might be valuable to our clients in Finance, Insurance, Healthcare, and Travel. If you know these industries and know where to find relevant algorithms, become a Curator. | We need help vetting algorithms, working with our engineers to upload algorithms to our platform, and potentially training algorithms. |
|How does it work?| 1. Send us your algorithm as a zip file, along with a detailed description and documentation. 2. We will assess your program to ensure it functions as described and is relevant to our clients. 3. After review, we will work with you to get the algorithm listed for purchase in our marketplace. | 1. Review our list of High Priority algorithms. 2. Search online data science communities, message boards, Github, and other places to find relevant algorithms. 3. Send us the list of algorithms you’ve identified. | We will work with you to define a Statement of Work that aligns with your skill-set and available time. |
|What's in it for me? | Our team will review your algorithm, and you will be compensated in the following way(s): If your algorithm is on our High Priorities list of programs, you will be compensated $1,000 after review and acceptance. If your algorithm is pre-trained on a high value vertical (financial data for example), then you will be compensated an additional $1,000 after review and acceptance. Once your algorithm is listed on our platform, you will be paid a percentage of the monthly fee our clients pay to use your algorithm, in perpetuity. | Our team will review the algorithms you find, and you will be compensated in the following ways: If the algorithm is listed on our marketplace, you will be compensated a one-time fee of $100. If the algorithm listed on our marketplace is pre-trained on a high valued vertical, you will be compensated an additional one-time fee of $100. | You will be compensated hourly, with an opportunity to interview for full-time roles if/when they become available. |",datascience,1567966984,GravityAI,9,8,True,2019-09-08

Crunched Deviance Residuals," Hello, I'm somewhat new to looking at residuals to assess how well a GLM is fitting. This is a [link](https://imgur.com/a/kxWF8E7) to crunched deviance residuals with predicted frequency on the x-axis and the residual on the y-axis. I am concerned because these residuals are less than zero and because the residuals tend to become more negative as the frequency increases. These residuals are coming from a GLM using the poisson family and a log link. In case it's helpful, this is in an insurance setting where the frequency is about 5%. What do you think are these residuals a sign the model is not performing well? If so, what can I do to improve the model performance. I could tweak variable bucketing / definitions more, but I can't tell if this is a sign that there is something systemic wrong with my model. Could using a negative binomial distribution help?

Paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07953](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07953)

Abstract:

Graph convolutional network (GCN) has been successfully applied to many graph-based applications; however, training a large-scale GCN remains challenging. Current SGD-based algorithms suffer from either a high computational cost that exponentially grows with number of GCN layers, or a large space requirement for keeping the entire graph and the embedding of each node in memory. In this paper, we propose Cluster-GCN, a novel GCN algorithm that is suitable for SGD-based training by exploiting the graph clustering structure. Cluster-GCN works as the following: at each step, it samples a block of nodes that associate with a dense subgraph identified by a graph clustering algorithm, and restricts the neighborhood search within this subgraph. This simple but effective strategy leads to significantly improved memory and computational efficiency while being able to achieve comparable test accuracy with previous algorithms. To test the scalability of our algorithm, we create a new Amazon2M data with 2 million nodes and 61 million edges which is more than 5 times larger than the previous largest publicly available dataset (Reddit). For training a 3-layer GCN on this data, Cluster-GCN is faster than the previous state-of-the-art VR-GCN (1523 seconds vs 1961 seconds) and using much less memory (2.2GB vs 11.2GB). Furthermore, for training 4 layer GCN on this data, our algorithm can finish in around 36 minutes while all the existing GCN training algorithms fail to train due to the out-of-memory issue. Furthermore, Cluster-GCN allows us to train much deeper GCN without much time and memory overhead, which leads to improved prediction accuracy---using a 5-layer Cluster-GCN, we achieve state-of-the-art test F1 score 99.36 on the PPI dataset, while the previous best result was 98.71.",datascience,1568038570,benitorosenberg,1,1,True,2019-09-09

Question re. Building SPSS Research Design - Google Ads Dataset," 

Hi all -

I was pointed here from another sub and told that you may be able to help me out here. Hopefully this post is in line with this sub's rules.

Here's the deal ... I am attempting to do research on Google PPC campaigns. I have used AHREFS to download a spreadsheet containing the information for an organization's entire PPC campaign (643 rows of data, precisely).

This is the information I have:

1. The keyword the ad is focused on (ie., what people have to search to see the ad on the search results)
2. The volume (the number of people who search for the term per month)
3. Difficulty (the number on a scale from 1-100 on how hard would it be to rank in the top ten results organically)
4. Traffic (the percentage of organic traffic that has historically clicked on ads for that search term)
5. The number of results in Google for the search term (not sure this is even relevant)
6. The cost-per-click (what the advertiser must pay Google each time somebody clicks on the ad)

My hope is to be able to construct a statistical model in SPSS that correlates which keyword is most worth while ""to go after"" after all the various factors I listed above are considered. Maybe, if I may, the ""sweet spot"" between cost and traffic?

Any thoughts or advice on how to go about getting that setup in SPSS would be more than appreciated.

Again: I am more than grateful for any help you can provide.

What Is A Data Warehouse? A Tutorial For Beginners,"A data warehouse is any system that collates data from a wide range of sources within an organization. Data warehouses are used as centralized data repositories for analytical and reporting purposes. It is challenging because of the following reasons:

* Data is sorted in different ways by different systems
* Data might be updated at different times for each data source
* Data might not make sense to the end user, in its current form

All of these and other challenges can be solved through the use of a data warehouse: [What Is A Data Warehouse?

Forming a “Data for Good” group,"Full disclosure, this is going to be a bit of a long post.

I’ve been in the analytics industry for about a year now, and have slowly been coming to the realization that serving the needs of whatever company I work for is not going to be fulfilling. To be clear, I don’t mean that the work isn’t satisfying, challenging, and stimulating, just that doing this type of work isn’t *fulfilling*. Furthermore, I feel as if it is unfair of me to put that kind of weight on a job which, by its nature, is designed to simply keep making people money.

Without getting into the weeds too much, I want to take the skills and techniques I’ve been able to develop through my schooling, side projects, and my day job, and use them for something that could be fulfilling. I also want to be able to help my community (I live in the Saint Louis, MO area; there’s no shortage of social issues around here). I know that there are hackathons and similar competitions that present themselves every few months, but I want something a little more consistent.  In short, I want to form a group  of likeminded people who would get together on a regular basis to tackle social issues in the area, like crime rates, child death, etc.

Would anyone happen to know how to go about starting such a project, and how to keep it going? I’ve checked out apps like Meetup to try and see if such a thing exists here and, and it seems like there is a panel that might meet up every now and then, but other than that my search hasn’t yielded anything.

Tips on improving predictive accuracy when number of features is low (2 only?),[removed],datascience,1568092995,chenresearchgroup,1,1,True,2019-09-10
Tips on improving random forest predictive accuracy when # of features is really low?,"Working on a random forest predictive model with a continuous response variable and two continuous features. Normally when I do RF projects I use some sort of feature selection method to choose which features to use. Then I fit the RF model onto those features. Then to test accuracy / related metrics I use cross validation, confusion matrices, etc.

However in this case I only have two given features. I don't want to just literally run a RF model on those two features as my whole entire project. I'm thinking gradient boosting is what I should learn? Also I think I should play around with the number of estimators and depth of the RF. I'm using sklearn in Python if that helps.

Any other suggestions? Obviously this type of problem/challenge is an unexplored area for me, so looking for best practices on how to add to my data science toolkit. Thanks!",datascience,1568093649,truryce,7,3,True,2019-09-10

Internship Doesn't Seem Interesting Anymore,"Okay, so I'm interning at this large automobile company, where they wanted an intern for an image translation research project. The initial idea sounded very, very interesting and that's why I accepted the offer (big name company+possible publication, seemed like a good opportunity).

Fast forward 2 months, and I've done sufficient literature review now to actually understand the topic. Turns out, what seemed interesting about the topic initially has already been implemented and the proposed changes to previous works is only minor/incremental (and dare I say, unwarranted/unnecessary or even misguided!). So much, so that now it doesn't seem worth it at all.

The question: What do I do in this situation? The whole internship has become uninteresting for me. What's worse, I'm worried that this project might become a deal-breaker if I apply to very serious places with this listed on my CV (It'll be hard for me to justify the said changes to xyz architecture). There are still 3 months left in the internship.
