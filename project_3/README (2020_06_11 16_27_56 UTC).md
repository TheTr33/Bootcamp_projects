# Project 3: Using NLP Classification Models to Categorize Articles by Subject 
##### Sree Gollakota

## Problem Statement
A science fiction blogger wants to start posting articles and miscellaneous thoughts about their thoughts about the Star Wars and Star Trek franchises as the latest Star Wars trilogy is finished, and new Star Trek tv shows are just starting up. They have written articles about the previous works of each franchise as they were released over the years as well but majority of these older documents were uncategorized and unorganized in the deep recesses of forgotten flash drives and cloud stores prior to the creation of the blog itself. After collecting all the documents into one hard drive, they reach out to me, a data scientist who does small freelance side projects, to see if there is anything I can do to help sort out the mess of documents so that they can post the articles according to the respective franchises they review. Therefore, I will create a model that will classify the category of Star Wars or Star Trek which can be given to a front end developer to implement into the clients website. 

## Executive Summary
The data used to train the models in this project was scraped from the r/StarWars and r/startrek subreddits using the Pushshift API. The scraped json data from the API request was populated into a pandas dataframe and filtered for nulls, removed and deleted posts, non alpha characters, and lowercase characters. Stopwords from the nltk stopwords library were also removed from the dataset. The cleaned dataset contained the following information: 
##### Data Dictionary
| Feature | Description|
|----------|:------------:|
|title| Titles of reddit post meant to represent title of client's articles.|
| is_startrek | 1 for Star Trek post; 0 for Star Wars post|  


The title column was then vectorized using a CountVectorizer to measure the Term Frequency of each word which would be used as the features in our training and testing data. 
##### Model Selection
A lasso logistic regression model was selected as the first classification model due to its effectiveness with large feature sizes and interpretability of coefficients. A gridsearch was implemented in order to test the best parameter combinations out of using the English stopword dictionary or no stopwords, and also a unigram, bigram, and trigram range in order to account for movie and show titles such as "Rise of Skywalker" and "Wrath of Khan", as well as franchise specific words like "lightsaber" and "phaser". These parameters were fed into the Naive-Bayes model that was tested as well which was chosen for its probability based classification method. 
##### Model Evaluation
The validation metrics used for both models were the testing and training accuracy scores of the best_estimator from the gridsearch, the sensitivity, and the specificity calculated from generated confusion matrices. There were initial concerns about the performance of the data due to a class imbalance of the scraped dataset. 62.3% of the scraped data came from r/startrek while only 37.7% came from r/StarWars. This is due to increase activity on the r/startrek during the time of this study relative to the r/StarWars subreddit as a result of the Star Trek: Picard show airing more recently and performing better than the slightly older Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker film. While bootstrapping the data with a higher concentration of r/StarWars posts would have been able to mitigate the effects of class imbalances, the final data used by the client will only have two classifications and therefore can be assumed that if the model can accurately classify a title as a startrek article, all articles that cannot be classified as startrek can be safely assumed to be a starwars title. With this assumption, the baseline score was taken to be 62.3% 

When evaluating the models, both models were able to fit to the testing data with low bias and low variance while outperforming the baseline. However, the Naive Bayes model yielded higher specificity and sensitivity scores despite the class imbalances. 

## Conclusions and Further Improvements
After running both a logistic regression and a Naive-Bayes classification model, it was evident that the Naive-Bayes model was the more effective model to use and will be the production model to be implemented and optimized. Further improvements to the model will include bootstrapping the dataset in order to increase the model's specificity and using a Tfidf vectorizer instead of a count vectorizer to account for the relevance of each word rather than just the term frequency.
