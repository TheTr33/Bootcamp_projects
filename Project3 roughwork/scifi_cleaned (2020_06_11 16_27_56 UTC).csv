anyone else fans legacy comic series,"Read them a long time ago (in a library ten miles away) when I was a kid and fell in love with them.

(Minor spoilers btw)

Recently got back into them and I'm on the fifth volume now. I'm loving how the series subverses expectations, *but in an actually good way*.

The Skywalker of the era starts as a nightstick-addicted bounty hunter, the Imperials and the Jedi are WORKING TOGETHER (kinda), and Darth Krayt DESTROYS the Rule of Two.

Admittably, Cade is *really* edgy, but considering  the history of the Skywalkers, it's fairly believable.

And I could make a post by itself on how badass Darth Krayt and his followers are. Hell, even the Moffs are cool. They don't rival Tarkin, but they're still really cool.

non star wars fan thoughts series conclusion rise skywalker spoilers,"My wife and I went and saw RoS the other day and I've had a bit to mull it over. Full disclosure, I have never really been a HUGE Star Wars fan. My interests had always steered more toward fantasy rather than sci fi. I had seen the original trilogy as a kid, and then I saw the prequels as a teenager, but I've never gone back for multiple viewings. I can see why it became a cultural phenomenon, but it was never really my genre.

Since Disney+ came out and all the movies were in one place (except for a few still lingering on Netflix), my wife and I decided to blow through them all again to get ready for RoS.

So, with a fresh viewing of the series in mind, I gotta say I didn't really like the ending to the Skywalker saga.

A huge theme of the series was of course dark vs light, and redemption for those who had fallen. My major complaint is that no one who came back to the light lived to enjoy their redemption. Perhaps that was the point and I just missed it..

Darth Vader turned on Palpatine and saved Luke, then died.

Luke, who never went to the dark side, played a part in creating Kylo Ren by thinking of killing him. I won't even get into this - I hated that they did this to Luke's character, and I know it's probably been discussed at length before. Anyway, he redeemed himself by returning from his self imposed exile and using the Force, delaying Kylo so everyone could escape, then died.

Kylo Ren was turned back to the light by Leia's voice, Rey's healing, seeing his father... He turned on Palpatine and saved Rey, then died.

I had HOPED that Kylo would survive. I know, it would have made for a cheesy happy ending, but it would have been nice for ONE redemption story to have a happy ending.

Also, at the end of the movie when Rey is whispering 'Be with me' to the Jedi, and hears their voices... I wish they would have actually appeared as force ghosts instead of just their voices. It would have been so bad ass for her to stand back up and face Palpatine with Luke, Yoda, Anakin, Obi Wan and Qui Gon, behind her. 

It's already been shown in the series that force ghosts can influence the world around them with the force. Hell, in the same movie Luke did it to convince Rey to fight. How bad ass would it have been for the final fight with Palpatine that these Jedi physically appear to help Rey? Even if it was just the ones who knew how to force ghost... Get Liam Neeson, Hayden Christiansen and Ewan McGregor back for one final cameo at the climax of a decades-old series for God's sake...

Instead we just got voices..

At any rate, as someone who has never been a Star Wars fanatic by any means, the series was overall enjoyable to watch. I feel that the ending, while sufficient, could have been SO MUCH better.",StarWars,1577751468,Mojo884ever,3,1,True,2019-12-30

spoilers force theory yet seen,"Keep in mind I don't think this theory has been voiced yet. And I don't claim to be an expert in starwars lore. But..
I see people complain quite often about how Rey and Baby yoda have been ""too strong in the force"" or the have had no training to do what they do. While I agree to a point. I also think it's possible there is another explanation. 

There was a movie I watched long ago starring Jet Li (I think) and essentially it was about...

-Parallel universes are real
-a 'life force' of sorts is split between all copies of an individual.
-dude realized if he killed all the other copies of him he got stronger. 
-proceeds to do so until the final 2 fight or somthing like that. 

Regardless. That line of thinking really interested me all through my childhood. And recently with all the new star wars coming out. The intensity and power with the force that is being shown could maybe be explained with this logic..

Now if you apply that 'split life force' logic to starwars. And think about how before order 66 there were many jedi. Thousands I'm sure.. 
Now even though we know the force runs through everything. 
Fewer jedi, or individuals allowed to use the force would maybe experience a more intense channeling of the force. 
Maybe causing some to be able to realize it for themselves without training. Like the broom boy in TLJ. Or how Rey and kylo are so powerful with only a fraction of the training of a true jedi master. Or... if you want baby yoda too. 

Personally I think baby yodas explanation is much more in depth coming from the unknown origins of his species. But I won't get into that now. 

I wanted to know what people thought of my

jedi training versus force,"As two distinct matters. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Force can move through non-Force Sensitives at times, being a part of all living things, but generally can only be deliberately used by Force Sensitives. This is, without tuition, usually an instinctual manner, although it does still reflect some of the abilities religions also display. The use of the Force relies on will and on belief; someone of great capacity but little mental acceptance will do far less with it than a weak being with a great deal of faith. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Jedi Training is partially to teach ways to use the Force and far more importantly to continually use it, as many raw users lack any kind of real endurance or awareness of just how many applications it has, but also matters with next to nothing to do with the practice of the Force. This is what primarily takes up multiple decades. The learning of such matters as:

&amp;#x200B;

Investigative skills, languages, martial arts, galactic history, planetary history, social structure, politics, piloting, communications, repair and mechanics, diplomacy, galactic and planetary law for peacekeeping, and more. 

&amp;#x200B;

Educations that take the course of a lifetime on occasion *individually* are instilled into youngling learners and later Padawan practitioners as skills they may, and probably will, need over the course of their Jedi career as multiplanetary intergalactic peacekeepers. 

&amp;#x200B;

The actual study of the Force and the length of time a Jedi education take do not always equate to one another. On some occasions, a Jedi Master with only a few years of direct training in and with the Force and nothing else may best a Jedi Master whose lifetime has been spread among different skills, whether in EU or, perhaps, in Luke's brief dark side outburst during Return of the Jedi. 

&amp;#x200B;

As the quicker, easier, and more seductive path, the Dark Side and its study are far more appealing to many than the slow and stodgy path of the Light, but neither are necessarily equated to length of training either. Training certainly does do some good, though; without acquired skill and endurance, even something of immense natural power might be helpless against someone with more knowledge. Such as, perchance, Luke's total unawareness of shields, lightning absorbing, or healing when Sidious was torturing him in Return of the Jedi. Or the Child's utter exhaustion manifesting hostile abilities for self defense, as compared to Anakin casually slaughtering people. 

&amp;#x200B;

Training is also totally required for more complicated rituals and powers, such as the Sith thought bomb, or the Nightsister magics.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: To wit, powers exist without training. Powers can be used without them. It can be used better **with** training. However, not all training has anything at all to do with powers. In fact, length of training, especially with Jedi in particular, is a bad measurement.",StarWars,1577755886,LordVendric,6,1,True,2019-12-30
last jedi rise skywalker failed force awakens,"Before I start let me say a couple things:

First off, don’t hate on the actors, they’re just doing what was given to them.

Second, if you disagree or have any sort of opinion on what I’m talking about, feel free to comment, just don’t be an asshole about it

With that being said, here’s my take on the sequel trilogy:

The Force Awakens was an amazing movie, with brilliant visuals, well placed jokes, and I think most people agree that it lived up to the hype at the time. The Last Jedi and the Rise of Skywalker didn’t. Why?

The short answer is just effort. Disney seemed to put effort into the Force Awakens. The Last Jedi and The Rise of Skywalker just felt sloppy and rushed.

I know a lot of people say that people are just mad because it wasn’t made for their generation but I feel that wasn’t the problem for most people. The problem was that the 8th and 9th movies just felt sloppy and rushed. Plus, Disney clearly didn’t do their homework on Star Wars lore and it shows in the last two movies.

First off Leia. Since when did Leia have force powers? As far as I know, it was never mentioned that she had force powers before the sequel trilogy, and I doubt that someone would find out this late in their life that they had force powers. It just doesn’t make any sense. I get that they wanted to have a strong female character but A) they have Rey B) you can’t just pull shit of your ass and call it Canon. 

Finn. Finn was a wasted character. I feel bad for John Boyega having to play him. A stormtrooper deserter who discovers that he’s force sensitive would’ve been a badass main character. Instead, all they did was have him yell “REY!” For three movies. 

Kylo Ren. Kylo Ren was such a badass villain in The Force Awakens, he was awesome. Then, they gave a shallow, low effort redemption arc. Why? He was such a cool villain why turn him? It would’ve been a lot cooler if he stayed a villain.

Rey. Rey was kind of cool, but the whole thing about her being a Palpatine was a waste. It wasn’t really a plot twist at all. Most people figured that she would’ve been related to someone big in the Star Wars universe. Honestly, it would’ve been a bigger plot twist if she wasn’t related to anyone, and she was actually just a nobody.

Force Healing. What? Was this ever a thing before this trilogy? This shouldn’t have been introduced, mostly because if this was a thing, Rey definitely wouldn’t have been the first person to do it. Someone on the Jedi Council during the galactic republic days would’ve definitely figured it out before her.

Ships. Star Wars starships was kinda what got me into Star Wars in the first place, so I was pretty disappointed when barely any new ships were added, and the “new” ships, were just reskins of other ships. It’s been 30 years since the fall of the empire, surely the First Order has some new ships, and the resistance would’ve gotten funding from the New Republic for larger ships. I mean, they had no capital ships.

I would be ok with another trilogy under a couple of conditions:

1. They wait a couple years. The reason why I say this is so they have time to ACTUALLY do some research on Star Wars lore

2. Declare Legends Canon again. Pretty much everyone I knew who read legends loved it, and I know almost everyone was outraged when they declared it non-canon. What was the point of declaring it non-canon anyway

3. EFFORT. Put some effort into making a good movie for fucks sake. The last two movies were sloppy and unfinished, and that can’t happen again. Make sure what your doing makes sense, and add some new stuff that doesn’t throw everything else out the window.


That’s my opinion on the sequel trilogy, feel free to tell me what you think.",StarWars,1577755954,YmraDuolcmrots,15,1,True,2019-12-30

This would lead to Kylo and the other remaining leaders looking for something that can help them take back the edge, which would eventually lead to finding the Emperor, who then provides them with the power to have the final showdown in E9.

Also , forgive me , I am not well versed in the EU / Legends / KOTOR

Disney and Lucasfilm should make standalone films set in the old republic prior to the first big battle / defeat of the Sith

Establish the old republic universe and introduce a lot of characters loosely tied together etc and culminate the films in the final battle and victory over the Sith setting up the peace and balance that existed up and until Palpatine 

Endgame isn’t a perfect movie , but the final battle and all of the heroes on screen together , coupled with Tony’s funeral is some of the most moving and emotional movie making of all time 

Disney/Lucasfilm should work to build a base of characters similar to the MCU and let the film universe build over 10/15 years so everyone can feel emotionally invested and tied to the characters

I'm sure the Dark Side is always lurking and there were countless force-sensitive beings who fell to temptation or lust for power, but at the time of Anakin, it seems that, if anything, the balance of power is shifted towards the Jedi. Balance would mean weakening their strength.

somewhat believable reason luke exile tlj,"I have recently rewatched TLJ in preparation for TROS for the first time since I saw it in the cinema. I was really upset after watching it, so much so that I did not watch it again until now, so please excuse me joining in on this topic quite late.

One of the problems I had with TLJ was the reasoning behind Luke's exile. As many others I assumed it was out of shame for having turned Kylo to the dark side and fear of doing so again with someone else. And for me this did not seem believable, because it did not really fit into the picture I had of Luke, especially with him not giving up hope for Vader.

However, I do not want to start another opinion war on TLJ, but rather tell you about another idea of reasoning for Luke's exile, which might provide a better explanation. I have not seen anyone else mention this before in comments and after a brief search for articles I could not find it as well, but please tell me, if you have seen this somewhere else, or if you think it is so obvious, that it need not be explained (or so stupid, that it does not make sense at all).

I believe Rian Johnson wanted to establish a mechanism in the force, where the force balances out the light and dark sides by itself (kind of like the in Matrix with Neo and Agent Smith). And I believe, that Luke became aware of it and wanted to end the Jedi in order for the force to balance itself out and automatically end the dark equivalent of the Jedi as well.

To me, this can be seen when looking at a couple of scenes:

# 1.: Luke explains to Rey, why he went into exile

&gt;Luke: I came to this Island to die. It's time for the Jedi to end.  
&gt;  
&gt;Rey: Why? Leia sent me here with hope. If she was wrong, she deserves to know why.

This is the first reason, that he gives. It is not just, that he thinks he made a mistake and that he is not the right person to fight the dark side or to use the force. Yes, he later on admits to that as well, but this is his main reason. The Jedi must end. Not just him.  
I think this point is easily missed by the later conversations where he admits to his individual failures with Kylo, but it's the first reason he gives us.  
He does not immediately give Rey further answers as to why. Only, after R2 shows him the old video of Leia in Episode 4, Luke goes to Rey and says:

&gt;Luke: I will teach you the ways of the Jedi and why they need to end.

So all of the lessons he gives her are to show why the Jedi must end. Not to prepare her for Kylo and not to show why he must end, but why the Jedi must end.

# 2.: Luke's first lesson for Rey about the force

&gt;Luke: \[The force is\] the energy between all things, a tension, a balance, that binds the universe together.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;Luke: Reach out with your feelings. What do you see?  
&gt;  
&gt;Rey: The island. Life. Death and decay, that feeds new life. Warmth. Cold. Peace. Violence.  
&gt;  
&gt;Luke: And between it all?  
&gt;  
&gt;Rey: Balance. An energy. A Force.  
&gt;  
&gt;Luke: And inside you?  
&gt;  
&gt;Rey: Inside me that same Force.  
&gt;  
&gt;Luke: And this is the lesson. That Force does not belong to the Jedi. To say that if the Jedi die, the light dies, is vanity.

The force is the balance. The balance between light and dark. The energy, that keeps this balance. No matter, what others do, be it Jedi or Sith, the force will keep light and dark in balance.  
He also says, that light does not equal Jedi. The light is in other things as well like life, warmth, peace, not just the Jedi. But as with death for life, cold for warmth and violence for peace, there is dark equivalent to balance out the Jedi.  
Luke has realized this. He does not want the light to die, but the Jedi to end, so that the dark equivalent will end as well. As with the first scene, it is not about him, it's about all the Jedi. And this is the reason why.

# 3.: Luke's second lesson for Rey

&gt;Luke: Now that they're extinct, the Jedi are romanticized, deified. But if you strip away the myth and look at their deeds, the legacy of the Jedi is failure. Hypocrisy, hubris.  
&gt;  
&gt;Rey: That's not true.  
&gt;  
&gt;Luke: At the height of their powers, they allowed Darth Sidious to rise create the Empire, and wipe them out. It was a Jedi Master who was responsible for the training and creation of Darth Vader.  
&gt;  
&gt;Rey: And a Jedi who saved him.  
&gt;  
&gt;Luke: Yes, the most hated man in the galaxy.  
&gt;  
&gt;Rey: But you saw there was conflict inside him. You believed that he wasn't gone. That he could be turned.  
&gt;  
&gt;Luke: And I became a legend. For many years, there was balance and then I saw Ben. My nephew with that mighty Skywalker blood. And in my hubris, I thought I could train him, I could pass on my strengths. Han was Han about it, but... Leia trusted me with her son. I took him, and a dozen students, and began a training temple. By the time I realized I was no match for the darkness rising in him, it was too late.  
&gt;  
&gt;Rey: What happened?  
&gt;  
&gt;Luke: I went to confront him. And he turned on me. \[...\] He must have thought I was dead. When I came to, the temple was burning. He had vanished with a handful of my students. And slaughtered the rest. Leia blamed Snoke, but it was me. I failed. Because I was Luke Skywalker. Jedi Master. A legend.

Luke tells Rey, that the image of the perfect Jedi is not real. They made mistakes, and these mistakes produced dark powers to balance out the Jedi themselves. The Jedi (in the Republic) became so powerful, that the force balanced them out by producing Darth Sidious, Vader and the Empire. And it did so not just by acting through dark forces, but by acting through the Jedi themselves as well (""It was a Jedi Master who was responsible for the training and creation of Darth Vader."").  
The same then happened the other way around. The empire became so big, that the light side was out of balance, and Luke was able to turn Vader back. For a while, ""there was balance"". But then, it got out of balance again, when Luke trained the powerful Ben and other students as light Jedi. And again, the force produced a dark equivalent with Kylo Ren and again by acting through the hands of a ""Jedi Master"".

Luke has seen this mechanism of the force multiple times in his own life and the history before him and he thinks the only way to stop it is for the Jedi to end. You cannot just be a perfect light Jedi with the purest of intentions. The force will find a way to balance it out, even by acting through you, if necessary. Later on, he tells Rey, that it was an instinct, that made him briefly attempt to kill Ben:

&gt;Luke: And for the briefest moment of pure instinct, I thought I could stop it.

We know from Episode 1, that by giving yourself over to your instinct, you give yourself over to the force. So it was the force, acting through Luke, balancing out the light side.

# 4.: Rey is brought before Snoke by Kylo

&gt;Snoke: Come closer, child. So much strength. Darkness rises, and light to meet it. I warned my young apprentice that as he grew stronger, his equal in the light would rise. Skywalker... I assumed. Wrongly.

This seems to support Luke's theory. Not just Luke, but also Snoke (possibly his dark equivalent?) believes in this mechanism. He thinks, that Rey is the light counter part to the dark rising of Kylo. This seems to be an indicator, that Rian Johnson wanted to establish this force mechanism as a thing in the Star Wars universe and not just as a weird phatansy of Luke (or me). So, Luke might actually be successful (and right) with his plan to end the Jedi.

However, later on, he changes his mind after Yoda appears to him. Yoda tells him, that his mind is ""still looking to the horizon. Never here, now"" and that ""Lost Ben Solo, you did. Lose Rey, we must not."", basically, that not just the overall balance matters, but also the people living in the here and now, which does seem to convince Luke in the end.

\---

However, to me, this reasoning for why Luke went into exile makes a little bit more sense and fits better to his character than him just being ashamed and afraid. However, I also think it just fits into the TLJ universe, i.e. just this one episode. This force mechanism does not seem to appear in any other film. Yes, some talk about balance between light and dark, but not in this way.  
And all the director switching back and forth did not make it any better. Maybe Rian Johnson wanted to go into that direction to end the saga, but JJ Abrams had other things in mind, when he started it with TFA and ended it with TROS. Or maybe this was not at all, what was behind all of this, and I am just completely mistaken.  
We will probably never know. But at least for me, that makes one of TLJ's flaws a little bit more bearable.

get people like tros good structurally plot wise,"It’s not a good movie. The pace doesn’t allow anything to sink in and be processed, and therefore ignores any nuances to story telling and caring about characters. They managed to eliminate any character development from the last movies by whisking them through a non stop Michael Bay explosion scene for 3 hours. Y

es, you can nerd out and explain how every detail is supported somewhere in the dialogue or film, but it’s on screen for 1 second, and then who cares. I appreciate how much effort it takes by the developers and cgi artists to do a film like this, but the director and executives clearly got caught up in fitting in every single fan service gimmick and forgot how to tell a good story. Not like how these films did in the past. For example in episode 4, there is a fairly long scene of just Luke, Obi Wan, Han and Chewey in a bar...socializing, bar fight, they meet jabba...nothing extremely special, but it made you feel like you were there. It developed who the characters are and why you care about them. Now, these new characters are riding rams in high altitude on top of ships for no reason, against clearly unbeatable odds, which only means there is an extremely predictable thing Rey and Kylo are going to do to win the battle for them. They are now “warp jumping” to anywhere in the galaxy instantly. No hyper drive malfunctions or creativity. Just bland, just-accept-it-happens-now film making. Basically there is no feeling ever that the characters are truly struggling and won’t make it out ok. Chewey is abducted for about 30 seconds. You just need to accept that they can do all of this now, and because of that theme, it loses any depth to the story and characters. I’

m sure it’s easy for people to argue back and forth about how this and that are explained here, here and here in the lore of the series. But it doesn’t make up for two bad movies. Not when these things are glazed over. Too much nonsense to cram in. The film didn’t work, the audience doesn’t care when it’s stylized this way, and this style of storytelling is why the movie is overall boring. The executives wanted to not only service fan fiction and gimmicks, but also include every single visible politically correct thing they can think of. This made it cringey at time. The movies pace made this movie forgettable. The story telling was a reach to begin with. It didn’t continue what happened and was told in episodes 1-8 well enough to feel like they were truly an extension of each other. There was no magic to any of the scenes. Daisy Ridley’s acting is one noted. It felt like Rey has a hard time conveying how she cares about things beyond surface level. Almost too smug in who she is. Partly because the script is bad, but also the actor doesn’t seem to buy into being in the universe, just how many intense faces can you make per scene. I never buy into what Rey cares about, or any of the main characters. John Boyega basically just yells the entire time. Fin yelling “Rey” two dozen times is all I remember from him. You can pick apart the movie in a lot of places for a while and are tempted to do so because of the great history from past Star Wars But, I’ll stop there, because generally the movie is annoying, terribly paced, and completely forgettable, despite beautiful cgi but poor editing. Likely too many cooks in the kitchen. I won’t be watching any of the new story until episode 10 is in theaters, so probably never. Just like how I didn’t watch episode 9 since episode 8 was in theaters. As a true fan going back to being a little kid watching Star Wars with my dad, it’s a sad ending to the saga, over 40 years later.",StarWars,1577764526,youthoughiwasgone,9,1,True,2019-12-30

theory palpatine,"TL;DR: Palpatine became a force wound after the destruction of the second Death Star.

Ever since seeing Rise of Skywalker, I have been convinced Palpatine had pulled a Darth Sion to ""survive"" the Death Star 2.  This alone, I thought, wasn't worth discussing.  However, another idea has come to mind, tangential to this idea.  With Revan being made canon, and Nihilus possibly appearing as a statue on exagall, I thought more over the implications of KOTOR on the canon universe.  Then it hit me:

*Palpatine became a force wound*

Consider how both Meetra Surik and Nihilus were made into living force wounds; they were present for the destruction of Malachor V, survived, and were deeply affected by it.  Meetra unconsciously cut herself off from the force, while Nihilus began to hunger, his appetite only sated by feeding on life forms, specifically force users.  Both of them were at an event that killed millions of sentients. So was Palpatine.

In Rise of Skywalker, Palptine states that he has died before, and his body looks it.  This is what originally led me to think about Darth Sion, who could have his physical body defeated, but would always return.  Given we have seen Darth Maul survive being cut in half by Obi-Wan and Anakins defeat on Mustafar, we have precedent to show that the sith can survive severe bodily harm by focusing on their pain and anger, like Sion.  It doesn't seem like much of a leap for Palpatine, whose master Plagius had supposedly found a way to cheat death, to be able to keep his spirit alive even after his body has died.  

This would leave him completely immersed into the force, making him far more vulnerable to the effects of the destruction of the Death Star 2.  The sheer amount of death would easily be enough to cause a force wound, especially as order 66 was only a few thousand Jedi.  Palpatine was at the epicenter of that wound, and it affected his spirit.",StarWars,1577765002,GamermanRPGKing,1,1,True,2019-12-30

Qi'ra succumbing to dark force users, getting caught up in Maul drama, not too huge a leap to think she'd cross paths with palpatine who - let's face it - is a pretty rapey character. Fo we think disney will ever do ajything with qi'ra?

hate rose rise skywalker,"Unsure if many other people feel this way, since she was not a popular character, but I really fucking hated how insignificant Rose's character became in Rise of Skywalker. She does jack shit the entire film, and it was blatantly just J.J. and co. appeasing the fans who were outraged at her presence in The Last Jedi. 

I should say at this point that I do not like The Last Jedi. In fact, immediately after seeing it I positively despised it. Rose had nothing to do with this though. Her character was alright, and Kelly Marie Tran did a fine job of portraying her. There was nothing really dislikeable about her, and quite honestly most of the backlash against the character seems to derive from a level of misogyny and/or racism. 

Like, I'm not suggesting they make Rose the centrepiece of the film but they could've at least given her something to do other than just being another footsoldier who makes the occasional mundane, innocuous comment. I actually found her far more likeable in The Last Jedi, in the sense that she was given some interesting lines and further played an interesting role in Finn's character development.",StarWars,1577765592,Cuckodile,23,1,True,2019-12-30
seeing tros thought would arrange opening act differently thinking done way reason spoilers guess,"I'm not sure if this is the place to discuss the nitty gritty of this hypothetical re-edit, but the TLDR is that it would mostly cut back and forth between Kylo and Palpatine talking on Exegol and Rey training on Ajan Kloss. (I somehow completely forgot about the glacier base scene. More on that later)

Earlier today I realized that a back and forth has two potential problems. First, it makes Kylo being back in his quarters relatively abruptly for the sequence where uses Vader's helmet to give Rey a vision, distracting her enough to let a tree fall on BB-8, breaking a plate. Cutting that scene entirely might not be an options, if only because later in the movie Poe notices and gives Rey shit for it.

But cutting back and forth between two disparate scenes presents a much deeper issue. It kinda reminds me of how the original cut of ANH went back and forth, and tension suffered as a result.

More recently I remembered that there was also the ice base sequence, and figured that cutting back and forth between that and Exegol would help with the surface level problem, but not the deeper one. On the other hand, the takeaways from the ice base scene were later relayed through dialogue: that Poe and co picked up intel, and there's a spy within the First Order, but no one knows who it is. So the scene could be cut altogether and just go between Exegol and Ajan Kloss, which would still leave those other two problems.

I'd imagine the actual editing team, who is staffed with (I assume) professionals, has considered all this and decided that having the three scenes be pretty much back-to-back instead of interwoven with one another flowed the best, as frantic as the opening scene was.",StarWars,1577765704,DoomTay,0,1,True,2019-12-30

midichlorians fit original description force,"In Star Wars episode 1 The Phantom Menace Qui Gon Jin talks to a young Anikin Skywalker about how the force works and talks about midichlorians. Qui Gon describes them as tiny lifeforms that live in cells that tell them how to use the force. 
In episode 4 A New Hope, Obi Wan Kenobi calls the force an energy field that surrounds all living things. I think that these two explanations of the force can go together and this is why
In episode 1 The Phantom Menace, the Jedi are in full public eye. It isn’t illegal to be one and they are seen as peacekeepers within the republic. All people have curiosity of what they can’t see and I feel that aliens are no exception to that. So some alien starts to think that why are our tax dollars going to these people who are basically police. That is where the midichlorians come in. The Jedi through together a story of how midichlorians tell us about the force and that the Jedi have more than other people and that is why they can use the force. Grandmaster Yoda tells the entire Jedi order to go along with this story if someone is to ask why they are so special. This works until order 66 where nearly all Jedi are wiped out. After order 66 most Jedi survivors were sent into exile just to live. We see that with some people like Obi Wan and Yoda that they used this time to learn about the force. During this time, with the Jedi mostly out of public eye, they go back to the original way of explaining the force to any person that is brave enough to ask. This works because the Jedi were seen as a myth most of the time so people didn’t ask for hard evidence of a energy field going through them. 
That is why I think that midichlorians do work with the energy field explanation from A New Hope.",StarWars,1577766636,Infamouspotato08,0,1,True,2019-12-30

headcanon obi wan secret father luke amp leia improves sequel trilogy,"**I know this theory has been around for awhile, but to recap:**

—Luke &amp; Leia are actually Kenobis, not Skywalkers. 

—Anakin's feeling that Padme was secretly with Obi-Wan behind his back was actually true. The creepier Anakin became, the more that Padme was drawn to Obi-Wan.

—When Vader learns about Luke &amp; Leia, he assumes they must be his children, because he feels their Force powers. But he's blinded by his vanity, and never corrected.

—Padme knows for certain that her children are Obi-Wan's, but she dies before she can confirm it to him. He's wracked with guilt about everything and becomes a hermit because he doubts himself. He doesn't want to get too close to Luke, so he watches from afar, thinking that anyone he loves will end up dying.

**Here's why it makes the sequels more fun:**

—Kylo Ren has built his whole identity around being the grandson of Darth Vader, but actually he's the grandson of the greatest Jedi Knight... not only is this cruelly ironic, but it also reinforces the idea that you are who you *choose* to be, not what your bloodline dictates. 

—Kylo Ren's downfall actually mirrors Anakin's more *without* the lineage... Ben Solo *should* be the purest good guy in the galaxy, but because of his mistaken idea about his heritage and the prophecy, he falls to the Dark Side.

**Lastly:**

—Almost nothing in the films directly contradicts this, except for Force Ghost Obi-Wan in ESB/ROTJ confirming to Luke that Vader is his father, and that he was telling the truth ""from a certain point of view."" But it's possible that even in the after-life, Obi-Wan doesn't know the whole truth. Or, he's just telling Luke what he needs to hear in the moment, to believe in the possibility of redemption for Vader, in order for the Rebellion to succeed. Though it's manipulative from Obi-Wan, it's also a gesture of love to Vader, and his way of apologizing to his old pupil for basically stealing his wife and family!

starkiller base ros instead tfa among things spoilers,"So some ideas that I think could have made the sequel better:

TFA's finale is simply fighting back an armada of star destroyers. Perhaps they were attacking the new republic and that's the first victory against the First Order.

 In TLJ, Palpatine is revealed to still be alive. Somehow Kylo finds him like he did at the beginning of RoS, and instead of kill Rey, he is instructed to kill Snoke and bring Rey. Snoke reveals that she is Palpatine's grand daughter and she must die(this is when he gets cut in half). Then Kylo wants her to join him to kill palpatine. Luke actually fights Kylo and is killed much like Obi Wan right in front of Rey. Instead of disappearing while sitting on a rock...

Fact: Palp had a son and a granddaughter, Rey.

Question: About what years did the births happen, assuming they happened naturally and the babies matured normally?

BBY is like BCE
ABY is like ACE
BBY countdown to 0 and then ABY up from 0

BY = Battle of Yavin 

Approximate dates of movies:

Episode II 22 BBY

Episode III 19 BBY

Episode IV 0 ABY

Episode V 3 ABY

Episode VI 4 ABY

Episode VII 34 ABY

Rey is 19 years old in Ep VII
Therefore, Rey was born about 15 ABY
In Ep IX, Rey’s father is played by Billy Howle
Howle is 30 years old
In the scenes where Rey is left on Jakku, Rey is about 5 years old. This would put that at about 20 ABY. Rey’s dad is about 30 in these scenes.
Therefore, Rey’s father was about 30 in 20 ABY and was born in 10 BBY.
And he was 25 when Rey was born
Episode III was in 19 BBY

SO....

9 years after Episode III, Sheev Palpatine’s son is born. This means an electrocuted, scarred, full scrotum faced Palp....did.....yeah. This also means Palp’s son grew up during Episode IV, V, and VI.

Rey‘s Birth 15 ABY (Father is 25)

Rey left on Jakku 20 ABY (Father is 30, Rey is 5)

unpopular opinion kylo ren main character sequel trilogy,"Rey essentially paralleled Luke's character arc, however the main difference between those two was that Luke's enemy was a ruthless killer who only showed pity towards the end  
 To see the Skywalker saga from the other side of the fence, the side of the hero turned evil, would be phenomenal. We see a brief insight of what the First Order is like during Fin's time there, however to fully see it function without it just being an overarching evil, and actually exploit the flaws and discrepancies of it would be so interesting.  
 On top of that, Kylo's character arc was a million times more defining then Rey's. A lot of the time I hear about how Rey is a Mary Sue, but whether or not you agree with it, you can't deny the struggles of Kylo Ren and the internal conflicts he went through were a lot more defining to his character, and seeing him relapse back into evil after TLJ only to come back didn't make sense, and only felt that way because they still needed a main antagonist. RoTJ wouldn't have to have the whole Palpatine trope at all with Kylo, instead maybe being about Kylo leaving the First Order and going into hiding at the end of TLJ (would make sense bc he killed Snoke), him finally relapsing to the rebellion and having them finish off the FO once and for all in RoTJ, *and* have the Rey/Kylo romance still be explored without him randomly dying. Shit, you could even have him die in the end as a way to keep the same type of ending as in RoTJ.  
 I'm obviously no million dollar screenwriter, and maybe when over simplified like this it makes sense, however I truly feel as though Kylo Ren could've been explored a lot more as a main character then what we see from Rey and the rest.

love letter rogue one,"I've had a bad taste in my mouth for the last couple of weeks from the way the sequel trilogy was handled. 

I just revisited Rogue One, which is not only far and away my favorite of the recent films, but maybe my favorite in the whole franchise. 

I understand why some people might not be a fan, but here's why I am.

I love a good war movie -- I'm a military dude that joined early enough in life that I needed a guardian's permission. I've been everywhere from a private, to an NCO, to a senior company grade officer. I've worked at individual, squad, tactical and strategic levels at a variety of jobs ranging between transportation to combat arms and intelligence. 

Rogue One *gets it right*. Everything from the staff meeting of higher ups debating strategic value of the mission down to the story of individual troopers sacrificing themselves for a friend. Top to bottom, the entire sequence starting from an hour into the runtime is an impeccable war film that just happens to be in the beautiful cinematic universe of Star Wars.

My favorite shot in the entire franchise is when the saboteurs are doing groundwork and Blue Leader unexpectedly swoops in to save them from the AT-AT. It's such a visceral moment that I can get chills just thinking about it, because even though it takes place a long time ago in a galaxy far far away, it's a moment anyone who's been given air support can feel. Gareth Edwards captured it *perfectly*, somehow. 

The whole movie feels so similar to the stories we've seen depicted of the sacrifices made in Normandy. With our knowledge of what the future holds for the rebellion, every trooper that falls, never knowing the consequences of this bold assault, becomes a hero. It's a look into a Hail Mary strategic play we know results in ultimate victory, even though everything's up in the air while it happens.

Disney has shown itself pretty incapable of making a space opera, judging by all of the SW films they've released, save this one. But they can film the hell out of a war movie set in space. 

I'll personally be satisfied with Disney's custodianship if for every 4 trash movies they come up with a Rogue One.

One last tidbit I wanted to mention.

Every time there's a wide shot of the Yavin 4 landscape in the entire franchise (even in TROS), there's always a fleet trooper sitting in a bucket. Sometimes he's got a hand scanner, sometimes he's holding a spear lol

The fuck is this guy doing? How did he get up there and how does he get down? Maybe he can't get down... maybe it's the same guy in every movie. 

He can't have a more sensitive handheld scanner than the base itself has, and he sure as shit isn't taking down any ships with a spear. Is his job to be the first one to die? Maybe the most well-liked RFT is assigned up there, so when he gets killed everyone else gets fired up for revenge.",StarWars,1577779413,TheYatesMachine,5,1,True,2019-12-31

luke went exile argument theory,"Put yourself in Luke's shoes. A young, powerful and talented Jedi in training, but still immature at heart kid who just a couple years ago spent his days goofing off with friends on their way to get power converters.

And let's face it, Luke's training kinda sucked. He didn't get the close, daily one on one lessons previous Jedi got. He got an old frog and a ghost. The only reason he manages to prevail is because he has a good heart and wants to do the right thing and the force kinda wills it to happen, in my opinion. Oh, and Anakin finally comes to his senses and decides not to destroy the legacy of Padme - her kids.

So Luke, still this young Jedi, is suddenly saddled with the huge responsibility of training the next spoiled and entitled generation of Jedi. Because the next gen is always spoiled and entitled. Okay boomer... moving on...

That is a huge responsibility, and Luke, always wanting to do the right thing, takes it VERY seriously. But, he is probably kinda traumatized from getting Sith electrocuted and facing such an evil power so young. He is EXTREMELY weary of the dark side and will try to keep it from rising again at all costs.

But then he begins to sense it in his young nephew. His nephew begins to hear voices from Snoke/ Palpatine/ whatever.

Luke could defeat the influence of the dark side in himself, and he could turn his Dad to the light, but stopping someone from turning to the Dark side is something he has never had to do and is probably harder than anything he had done before. Think about it. Star wars has a few redemption stories, but preventing a fall to the dark has yet to be done in the star wars canon.

As a parent, I sympathize with Luke in this situation. Kids don't come with manuals, and neither, I assume, do padawans. I imagine Luke panicked a lot, and probably had some serious anxiety leading up to the fateful night when he considered ending that growing evil. Also, as you get older, things become less black and white, less distinction between light side and dark side, and you start seeing the gray areas. With age, you start understanding that some sacrifices are for the greater good, etc. For a brief moment, Luke had convinced himself (likely with the encouragement of whispers from a thought to be dead Palpatine) that killing Ben was a sacrifice to stop much, much greater death and destruction down the road. Can you imagine how the idea of a new  Emperor terrified him? (to Luke, the only embodiment of the dark side he has known was the Palpatine). After all he went through to destroy the last one?

But he didn't follow through with it, because Luke is really good at one thing: keeping himself on the light side. Unfortunately, he had already gone too far by drawing his blade, and he solidified Snoke's/ Palpatine's influence over Ben.

So in the end, Luke, always so dedicated to doing the right thing, failed. He did the wrong thing. It didn't matter that he ultimately changed his mind. He got unlucky, and being tempted, not carrying out the temptation, was his failure. Nobody here can fault him for being tempted. Everyone is tempted by the dark side (except maybe Yoda and Obi-Wan). Actually, I think Obi-Wan was tempted by the devil for three days or something... wait wrong story. I digress.

 Speaking from experience, when you really really want to be good, and then you end up being an ass hole for just a few seconds, it is like all the good you have ever done doesn't matter. The shame, the guilt, etc can be crippling. You want to hide. You want to run away. You question your ability to even be the person you tried to hard to be and failed.  


Luke realized that he wasn't up to the task of restarting the Jedi order, and quite frankly, he was probably right. He had more than he even knew working against him, namely the same dude who destroyed the Jedi order to begin with. Luke was set up to fail. He could never have succeeded, and he wasn't meant to.

The battle with Palpatine was far from finished. The force knew it but he didn't.

Luke's exile and subsequent bitterness and bad attitude make so much sense to me, especially after Rise of Skywalker. Luke had taken on a task with good intentions, and then fallen into a trap set by Palpatine himself. An unseen enemy is almost impossible to fight. Perhaps Luke sensed that he was out of his depth, which helped him justify his exile. He probably felt like the universe was against him (it was) and just couldn't maintain hope after his screw up. I would certainly be discouraged too.

Make a new organization that is not like The Empire at all, and dont make the heroes part of another version of the rebel alliance. 2) Have the Big Three Luke, Han, and Leia in the same scene or have them be together for at least one movie. So sad that we never got this at all, that should have been the number one thing on your list screenwriter!!! 3) Make the villains different with each film the OT had a different main villain each film, as did the prequels. Have a big bad like Palpatine over the course of the entire trilogy and dont bring Palps back unless it is some kind of force ghost. and 4) Have Luke Skywalker get into a lightsaber battle, its is a huge wasted opportunity to NOT give him at least one fight, since I was little I wanted to see an older Luke have am epic lightsaber fight.

star wars x take,"This is one of my many opinions on the saga, and it more focusses on why I don't think the sequel trilogy works as a whole piece, I'm not dissing them as on a whole I enjoyed them but just feel something is not right.

Since watching TROS and subsequently re watching the sequel trilogy, one thing keeping on coming back to me, and that is that it just doesnt seem to fit in the SW Timeline/Lore.

Since re-watching  I feel that if you watch 1-6 that despite the poor execution of the prequels they do a amazing job at building a galaxy, you have the politics, storybuiliding all going on, and with the additions of Rebels and Clone wars , it does an great job at setting the scene, to me it is very much like looking at the history of a nation. For example if you were to look at a snapshot of Scottish History i,e (from the Birth of Robert the Bruce to the death of Bonnie Prince Charlie &lt;around 500 years&gt;) you would see the peaks and troughs of rebellions and hardship etc, much th same with looking through 1-6, the story and backbuilding of the galaxy is all there.

Now step forward the sequel trilogy and can you say the same? for me no, as if it was not for the addition of OT Characters and possibly a couple of the accompanying novels there is very little that sets this within that timeframe little to no effort has went to explaining the political scene or what the OT characters have been doing, and for me it's something that should have been glaringly obvious.

disney clean slate canon best thing happened,"Talking to folks online, I've been learning some of the new canon books do explain the reason there's a Resistance and First Order, even after the Empire falls at the battle of Jakku. I've also been playing through the Battlefront 2 campaign and appreciate how much it harmonizes with what the new movies were doing.

I feel simultaneously good that the story, when put together, is some of the best SW we've had in decades, and bad that it really has to be put together to get there. My biggest gripe about TFA and TLJ has always been the distinct lack if context and conclusion. Having more of the pieces gibes me more insight into the beautifully and thoughtfully crafted narrative they clearly started with at the outset.

I just wish there had been a bit more transparency between these pieces. I suspect this is the same, ""Captain Marvel was filmed in EG before her solo film"" problem where the books and games were omitted so the movies wouldn't paint them into a corner, but honestly, the movies would have been much more intriguing if they dropped more telling hints about what happened in the books and games. 

The reason I say the new canon is the best SW is that it's simple and streamlined. We all know the EU books were often convoluted and difficult to explain (not that this was bad, but it was harder to get into). 

I left the movies feeling that if there was anything worthwhile, there has to be a lot going on that the movie doesn't tell us about. The truth is that there is, and it's awesome, so I wish they had been a bit more upfront about it in the movies. But what they are building (so far as I've seen) is a beautiful, streamlined framework that honors many of the best aspects of the legends canon.

idea sequel trilogy,"After finishing  TRoS, I would like to share some of my idea about the sequel trilogy, that ""balance"" of the force is not ""Light side wining"" but is some time having some darkness in the light while also remain some light in totally darkness. Similar to the theme and idea of Chinese Tai Chi. So lets begin, the not mentioned part remain same as the movie.

1. Force awaken

Start with Ben's friend (a random character ""A"", not important, a adventurer maybe) is missing in the unknown region and he sense he/she is in danger. He asked Luke for permission to go search but Luke replies with the Jedi Order Rules: Attachment is forbidden and should not interfere with other's affair. He begged the New Republic to send a search team but they said it's too costly. He stole a ship and arrive where ""A""'s fleet last single was find, but he only found debris and bodies. Anger lead to hate, Kylo wants revenge on the Luke, the Jedi Order and the New Republic, at the same time, Snoke appears and lead him to the dark side...

On the other hand, live on Jakku alone, Rey lie, steal or even kill to survive, without hesitation, as it was naturally born with her. Until Poe and Finn crashed beside her. For the first time, instead of killing them and loot as she always does, she helped them and make friends. Their friendship warms her heart and bring her to the light side... 

2.The Last Jedi

Both green and blue saber of Luke is destroyed in the fight between Rey and Kylo.

As the resistance escaping with their transport, Holdo shield them and blocking the path of the Supremacy with the hull of the cruiser, on the same time, ignite the reactor core for self-explosion. Hux see through the trap and warned Kylo to avoid the trap but he was too eager to hunt down the resistance. He order the Supremacy to charge through, resulting the destruction of the  Supremacy. Hux barely escaped, giving more reason for his betrayal...

On the planet, Luke used up all his energy with the ""dual"" with Kylo and become one with the force. Symbolizing Kylo killing off the last Jedi. (Both Rey and Ben have not finished their training to become a Jedi/Sith)

3. The Rise of Skywalker

At Exegol, Rey is blocking Palpatine's lighting with Anakin's blue saber together with Ben, holding Leia's gift, it's the red saber of Vader. They reflect the Emperor' s lighting to himself and defeated him. Ben has finally ended what Anakin's has started: Ending thousand generation of Jedi/Sith and their war. fulfilling the chosen ones destiny to bring balance to the force.

After defeating Palpatine, Rey who is born in total darkness but embraced the light side. Ben who learn the light side but pull by the dark side.  They created a new clan and named it the ""Skywalkers"". The ""Skywalkers"" will find and train Force sensitive younglings the basic control of the force so that they won't hurt them-self or people around them. After basic training, they can choose to stay and further train in both dark/light side of the force to become another ""Skywalkers"". They can feel anger but will not blind by it, they can form attachment but will not fall for it. With both knowledge of the Jedi and Sith, the ""Skywalkers"" truly rises and bring balance (both light/dark side) to the Force.

Minor changes that does not affect the storyline

a. Instead of poking right into Kylo guts, Rey chop off his hand on Death Star II and stabilize his wound after that. I mean, no one ever survive a direct stab of a light saber. Also, every Skywalker's needs a robotic arm.",StarWars,1577791127,Resonant_Heartbeat,0,1,True,2019-12-31

bounty hunter story,"**Hey guys I am new to Reddit. I would like to share my idea of a new Boba Fett movie. (It is my idea, nothing here is canon!) If you like it please let me know :) .**

**Chapter I : As the Bounty Hunter has lost control he falls in the Sarlacc's mouth. He doesn't know what to do next. He has finally accepted death. Suddenly , a grenade falls from his pocket and explodes right infront of the Sarlacc. It doesn't kill it , but it gives enough time for Boba to fall straight into the Sarlacc's mouth instead of letting the Sarlacc's teeth enjoy him. He realises he doesn't have much time before he dies inside the Stomach of the monster ,  so he tries to think quickly. Fortunately, he finds the body of a Mandalorian in there. He is lucky enough to find a working jetpack. Then he destroys a tooth from the Sarlacc and the Sarlacc feels pain. It opens its mouth so Boba escapes with the jetpack. He wants to kil Han Solo now so he loads his blaster. Han Solo and his friends have already escaped so it is too late for the Bounty Hunter. He gets in his ship and leaves Tatooine. His next destination is Hoth. He wants to meet Vader. On his way to Hoth , he notices the new DeathStar. He decides to stop there thinking that Vader may be there. The new troopers don't recognize him so they start firing. His ship is still in a good condition but the engines are destroyed. Smoke comes out of the engines as his ship falls to Endor.**

star wars go,"So I was thinking out loud that ""Star Wars"" might be in a bit of a quandary. The Skywalker Saga films are over, the anthology films are on standby after ""Solo"" wasn't all that well-received, but ""The Mandalorian"" was very well-received. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think the future of ""Star Wars"" would work best on television or on Disney+ in an episodic format similar to ""The Mandalorian,"" where they can tell stories and expand on a world in an extended manner, while having room for side quests and things.

&amp;#x200B;

However, with the amount of money that Disney paid for Lucasfilm, is there enough money to be made simply by going down the TV road? ""The Mandalorian"" felt very high-budget, yet the revenue for it comes from subscription fees for Disney+ and merchandise licensing. They don't have the option to sell advertising during that show. Is Disney willing to keep putting money into shows like that to keep them on the streaming service? Can they put them on ABC to sell ad space? What movies can they make that will work in that context?

opinion sequel trilogy fatal flaw use star wars past,"The sequel trilogy should have started over a brand new horizon. Using the old characters (Luke, Leia, Han, C3PO, R2D2, etc etc) only managed to:

1. Raise impossible expectations, creating controversy;
2. Stunt the potencial of the new trilogy.

The sequel trilogy could never hope to match its predecessors - its not only a matter of quality, its a matter of *nostalgia*. Fans want to see their past characters as they were, and  would have a hard time (as they did) accepting new versions of said characters.

Secondly, the new films is filled with too many parallels:

Hero with issues of its past; A desolate, sand-like planet filled with criminal scum; A droid carrying vital information;  A senior, mentor- like figure that the hero conects with and its killed;  Masked villain with a mysterious, powerful, evil master; A powerful weapon of mass-destruction;  A disgrunted, secluded, reluctant teacher; and others I cannot remember.

jj abrams skywalker saga russo brothers infinity saga,"They know how to honor the fans in a way that’s both true to the comics and highly cinematic. 

Given the continued rumors of some unexpected characters re-appearing, I‘ve become convinced that we’ll see a lot, if not ALL, of the major characters from episodes 1-6 reappear... and I think some of them will appear as force ghosts on both sides.

Obi Wan. Qui Gon. Palpatine. Duku. Luke. Han. Yoda! Mace Windu! Anakin.. Padmé! 

And others who are alive join in for a finale, almost like the Force itself will somehow bring everyone together (I know it’s not how it works) but akin to the Avengers Assemble moment in Endgame, it could be both a cinematic climax (decades in the making) and a heartfelt send-off to the characters we’ve grown to love and admire. 

Like Marvel, I think Star Wars has also gone to extreme lengths to protect secrets as potentially as big as this, and even altered trailers. And in the same way, I think the plot of future Star Wars theatrical movies will be very closely linked to the shows on Disney+

And so with that, this is my Cohiba, my Montecristo, my Eiffel Tower, my Rachmaninoff's Third. If it were any smarter, it would be Yoda. Right at the end, when the spatchka really hits the fan, someone unexpected will save the day. Who do you think it will be?

person understands last jedi,"Don’t get me wrong, TLJ is not without it’s flaws- no Star Wars movie is- but I really don’t understand the hate this film gets. I see all kinds of “arguments” online or in video essays about how people just “don’t understand” how certain scenes exist when it was blatantly obvious to me the first time I saw it. 

An example would be the scene where Luke milks the creature and drinks in front of Rey. This moment is constantly joked about or questioned or said to be pointless when it had a very clear point- Luke showing Rey how bad/gross life is on the island so she will leave him alone. So much is said in just a small amount of time yet nobody seems to get it. 

Again, this film is not without it’s flaws, but I just don’t understand why so many people seem to think it’s the dumpster fire they say it is. I’ve tried, I’ve really tried but I don’t get it. I want to start an open an non toxic discussion about this.

They all have some great moments. They all have some not so great moments.

Anakin doesn't force choke Padme, he real chokes her. He used the Force to squeeze her eyeballs to pulp. But before he does that, there will be some heavy handed foreshadowing that he's controlling.

Watto would brutally beat Anakin and his mother. Anakin  tortures him for information when he returns to Tatoonine

full scene of Shmi being beat as a slave and her death is far more gorey, something like having her innards brutally ripped out and being left to die alone in the desert.

theory baby yoda connection snoke emperor palpatine,"I have a theory about baby yoda and his possible  connection to Snoke and Palpatine. (Spoilers Below)


 In episode 1 of mandolorian we see a character known as The Client who has a bounty for (baby yoda)  and a scientist named Dr Pershing in episode 3 Dr Pershing and the client can be heard through a wall talking about extracting the necessary material and be done with it the audio cuts out and dr pershing says he explicitly told us to bring it back alive.

Now here comes the theory I believe that Dr Pershing has been hired by the remnants of the empire to create the first perfect clone of a force user to be used in resurrecting Emperor Palpatine. They eventually get close and manage to make a force using being but he is horribly disproportionate and is not perfect but strong with the force and they attempt to kill him and fail this eventually becomes Snoke and he is given a second chance at life by being a pawn a distraction to rey and kylo's true destiny.

Another theory I have is Emperor Palpatine is alive somehow and they do make a perfect clone and fail like the theory above but use these clones connected to a machine that Palpatine can drain the life out of them with while the machine keeps him alive like life support. We may see this in the trailer where rey is looking up at a machine lowering in front of her with what appears to have Palpatine strapped to it but we will have to see.",StarWars,1575194337,magnumninja,3,1,True,2019-12-01

However there is something else that I have had on my mind since the first episode that I now al convinced of. Did the empire put out a bounty for a member of Yoda's species in a bid to use its cells to try and ressurect or clone the Emperor? Battlefront II demonstrated that Palpatine had contingencies in place in the event of his death and with his knowledge of the force and pursuit of immortality it only makes sense that he would have a plan for key scientists and officers to execute a plan to being him back that he deemed the most likely to succeed.

question padm aotc,"So, I'm currently rewatching through AotC and I'm at the scene were Padmé is packing for her leave of absence while talking to Anakin about opposing the Military Creation Act. This struck me as odd and I wanted to know if I missed something. I'll explain what I mean.

In TPM we see Naboo under siege by The Trade Federation, which is a large Trade Company(?) with a large security force of Driods and Tanks. Naboo is invaded despite the Jedi interfering and the whole main plot of the movie is the liberation of Naboo. Padmé is of course the Queen of Naboo and I assume acts as the head of their security force. Which was unable to prevent the invasion.

Now from what I can tell Padmé is willing to use lethal force against these invaders and even attempts to recieve aid from the Republic to put pressure on the Trade Federation so they back off. What would cause Padmé to go from this to be completely anti-military in AotC. I think it would be responsible and reasonable for Padmé to bolster Naboo's military strength after they repelled the TF. In fact, most people I know who have been victimized by a violent crime often seek to arm themselves for defense, whether it's a firearm or a bat or pepper spray. For Padmé to take the stance she does politically as a senator seems to incongruent with what she did in TPM. Does anyone have an insight to this?",StarWars,1575203360,Wardripnate,9,1,True,2019-12-01
duel fates new trailer would wanted jj clone wars cross,"Firstly, let me start by saying I'm not a obsessive Star Wars fan, I know almost nothing about the EU and all my knowledge comes from simply enjoying the movies and animated TV show. However, as a big fan of the prequels (more the animated show than the movies themselves) I really didn't feel the new movie trailer deserved to have duel of fates in it. So far there has being almost no prequel references, and they killed off most the OG stuff. Just feels like they're trying to tug on our heart strings and bring us into a movie that might show one deactivated battle droid for 1 scene in the background. 

So, basically here is my fan fiction and what i would have liked to have seen/see in the new movies include themes from the clone wars and OG movies more.   


Episode 7: leave it as it is. Okay introduction to the film series and helps introduce the characters. Some flaws but overall not terrible. 

Episode 8: Keep similar story beats but rework the film. In response to their Death Star Mk3 being blown up they go full revenge mode and just obliterate the Resistance. There genuinely seems no hope for the entire movie, no silly adventures with Mary Poppin kids, no hyperdrive suicide bombing or a hold out on Hoth 2 electric boogaloo. Seeing the full might of the First Order nobody dares to intervene and there is absolutely no backup from anyone. Most the plot is a slow get away dealing with grief and an exploration into when you should give up or should you hold onto hope until the end. Fin could even be a useful character study. Moreover, Fin likely has seen a lot of people killed but now he's seeing people killed from another perspective. Meanwhile, Rey is debating with Luke. They basically have the same plot with Luke refusing to take part, already loosing hope because of something (maybe don't even tell us). Luke, however, actually starts to feel the pain his sister is going through (losing hope) and feels immense regret for causing this (because he distrusted is nephew). Kylo still has his vision thing with Rey and gets them both on the ship to be captured. Snoke still tells Rey she is a nobody (because she is, much like Anakin is just someone the force chose (regardless of what the EU might say)) and at this point Luke does something to injure (not kill) Snoke to get away after failing to persuade Kylo to join him again. Snoke is all like ""go get them!"" then Rey and Luke have a cool fight with Kylo in a engine room (similar to Episode 1 vs Maul). After a bit of dialogue, Luke sacrifices himself in order to persuade Kylo to join Rey (with debates coming from Rey who uses her intelligence and experience of loneliness and pain to persuade Kylo to join her). Kylo realises what he has done from her words and decides to help the resistance get away...   


Episode 9: The movie takes place a few years after Episode 8 and the Resistance are still licking their wounds. Kylo has being teaching Rey in both the dark side and light side of the force. There could have been some emotional scenes with Kylo and his mother scattered in. Snoke at this time is looking for a magical mcguffin that will give him the ultimate power to fully take the galaxy. Basically, the usual plot takes place (most likely the plot of this new film if writers are still using the same old tropes) of a big wacky race across the universe for this magical mcguffin. People sacrifice themselves, the Emperor is somehow still alive and is the magical mcguffin, ect... However, the Resistance, still having nothing that can even touch the first order (still hiding on the outskirts of the galaxy) stumble across an entire Droid army from the Clone Wars. Now, this is where the fun begins. The final battle that takes place is a full on mixture of all three films! You have Snoke battle the Emperor all while a giant war happens in the stars above! A Droid army with Resistance and Rebel pilots battle the First Order with the Emperor having Star Destroyers (as we have seen from the posters). At this point, duel of fate starts to play with a mixture of all three themes and it really feels like it deserves it. Snoke is killed by the emperor, Kylo and Rey then get to the planet and battle the Emperor, Kylo sacrifices himself, still feeling regret for what he did, Rey kills the Emperor once and for all. Movie ends rapping all three films up.

epix die,"Okay, I don't bet this is the most original of posts, but I haven't found one that was exactly about the same thing.

**The idea would be for us to discuss what we think will happen to the franchise's characters in Episode IX (namely if you think they'll stay alive or not). Here are my first thoughts:**

— **REY**: Probably nothing much going on, she'll win in the end, as always

— **FINN**: Unlikely to die, though that's a possibility, I think

— **POE**: Similar to Finn, honestly

— **ROSE**: Again, she probably won't die, but let me add I think she really shouldn't, especially after all that's been going on after Ep. VIII

— **LEIA**: If we're being logical, she's supposed to die at some point, like her husband two episodes earlier

— **BB-8**: Not much going on, I assume

— **C3-PO**: We may wonder, especially since the trailer where everyone was unsure of what to think. Many assumed it was just a way of speaking, just before doing something dangerous, like the final battle. Others pointed out it was because he will be committing sacrifice. That's probably been discussed a lot on this subreddit.

— **R2-D2**: Good question. If R2 “dies”, the last character that's been here since Ep. I that I can think of would be gone, so I wonder what you think.

— **CHEWBACCA**: I honestly don't know. There would be reasons to kill him, though he needs a really great scene. He at least deserves a scene like what Luke got.

— **KYLO REN**: No clue.

— **PHASMA**: Knowing JJ's and Johnson's fight, he might just make her come back, just like that

— **SNOKE**: \[REDACTED\] (no, seriously, I'd rather not talk about him, I don't know why he's in my list)

— **HUX**: He's probably gonna die, I think

— **LANDO**: He *obviously*\-so-much dies, that's not even subject to discussion (it's almost spoilers at that point)

— **ANY NEW CHARACTERS**: Logically, they shouldn't die, as we introduce them to insert them in the saga so that side stories can be told about them (in *Rogue One* too, it was possible to imagine the characters' back stories, even though they all die at the end)

&amp;#x200B;

bothers people say disney ruining star wars,"They're not. They have NOTHING to do with the creative process. Disney looks at the movie and says ""yes this will make money"". Disney has owned Marvel since 2012 and those movies have been critical and financial successes and fans LOVE them. Lucasfilm and Kathleen Kennedy are the ones in question. The MCU has come this far because of Kevin Feige. We need that for star wars. I don't hate the new star wars movies, in fact I love the force awakens, rogue one, and solo. The last Jedi is my least favourite star wars movie but hey it's still star wars. We need someone as passionate as Kevin for star wars.

unpopular opinion mandalorian better show releasing episodes one time,"Ok hear me out, I wish I could binge it all the same as everyone else, but I actually really love that they’re just doing it week by week. 

My main reason, is that this causes speculation and discussion about the show that other shows now don’t have. When there’s a new Stranger Things season, people binge the whole thing immediately and talk about it for 2 or 3 days. The first episode of the mandalorian was 3 weeks ago now and people are still talking about it a lot. And not only are they talking about it, they’re discussing theories and hopes and so much stuff that benefits the show and the fans. 

You can say all you want that this is just Disney making sure people don’t watch it all in their free trial, and you’d probably be right, but that doesn’t change the fact that this show has caused more positive discussion than any piece of Star Wars media maybe even since the OT. And by that I don’t mean it’s the best thing since the OT, I just mean that this is the first thing since then that fans seem to agree on, and talk about speculation and theories rather than just fighting about it. The week by week format is causing this to be a constant point of positive discussion rather than just something you think about for a few days. Yes it’s frustrating, but I think this format is definitely better than the alternative.

TL;DR: the show has kept Star Wars fans having constant, healthy discussions for 3 weeks now rather than fighting or praising just for a couple days after the release.",StarWars,1575205505,handslikezeus,971,1,True,2019-12-01

Perhaps what makes Vader so interesting and fun is that, although iconic, he doesn't appear *that* much in the OT and PT. So when we do see him, it's exciting and fun. 

I just thought that since technology is infinitely better since 2005 (back when he mattered to a main Star Wars trilogy) that we could get one? You know, with better CGI and fight scenes maybe??

Perhaps a solo adventure of him hunting Jedi? With a climax being a confrontation with Ahsoka? I mean, he had to have been doing something between III and IV right? The EU did expand on this, but those aren't canon anymore.

I said that rather than saying that one trilogy is better than the other why can’t we just enjoy the movies. This wave of hate enveloped me as people told me Rey is a Mary Sue who ruined Star Wars. I said everyone in Star Wars is a Mary Sue which they are, that’s why people enjoy these movies is for the action and the characters who are larger than life. Then people said, “ You’re biased and nitpicking.” I am so frustrated at this stupid arguing over how bad the sequels are. Why can’t people enjoy them. We are Star Wars fans damnit we shouldn’t be separated. I know that posts like these aren’t usual on this subreddit but I just had to say how frustrated I am with people that want to separate a fan base rather than unite it.",StarWars,1575215390,gayus-maximus4456,43,1,True,2019-12-01

anybody else think anthology films damn amazing,"Rogue One was basically a Star Wars Military film and might be my favorite film after the OT, they introduced the partisans and erased the image of the squeaky clean rebellion..

Solo had the sense of adventure of A New Hope, and we got to see Imperial Army troopers and some of the best practical creature effects ever in a Star Wars film (Proxima, Corellian Hounds).

It sucks that Solo did so terrible, because those movies were damn good.. I like the sequel trilogy but i feel these anthology films had so much more potential.

alternate sw timeline anakin successful defeating obi wan,"The high ground is not enough of an advantage for Obi Wan, Anakin manages to kill the Jedi master where he stands. Here’s what I think will happen following the fight... 

Anakin remembers Padme lying on the platform, barely alive, he quickly boards the ship with Padme and rushes her to the medical facility on Polis Massa. She gives birth, as Anakin watches the medical staff deliver Luke and Leia. 

When the delivery is complete, a medical droid informs Anakin of Padme’s failing health, and how the cause is unknown. This unfortunate news sends the new dark lord into a fit of rage, where he hacks and slashes the medical droids. 

Anakin takes in the two newborns, is too filled with grief, pain, anger, and on a leash with Palps, to be able to attend Padme’s funeral. Sometime later, he has his canon palace built where the children are housed, but not cared for by Anakin directly. 

Vader eventually gets his red lightsaber based on the Marvel comics, I’m not going to spoil that... 

Anyhow, Vader remembering how Palps explained that the dark side of the force is capable of bringing loved ones back to life. Vader attempts to convince Palps to teach him the power. Palpatine informs Vader that there’s more important matters to attend to, but Vader goes into a fit of rage and screams at Palpatine that Padme is dead. 

Palpatine gives him a “I know, and I don’t care” monologue, and reminds him they have an empire to run. This only angers Vader even more, to the point where he draws his lightsaber, but Palpatine’s power is simply too much for Vader to handle, and he’s easily defeated. 

Whenever possible from that point onwards, Vader tries to delve into the Sith teachings to find out how to bring those back from the dead. He unfortunately couldn’t find the answers, which only pent up more rage and anger in him. 

When Luke and Leia become old enough, Vader then begins to teach them the ways of lightsaber combat, and forces the brother and sister to duel. His training program is strict, forcing the two to undergo entire days of combat, and harshly punishing the two should they fail, or show weakness. 

Ultimately, Vader is able to sense how strong the two are in the force, Vader has a desire of using the “happy family” to defeat Palpatine. 

As Luke and Leia are old enough to wield a lightsaber, Vader sends them on dangerous missions as his assassins, the missions will vary. Palpatine will eventually discover what Vader is doing, which results in Palpatine threatening to kill Luke and Leia if Vader won’t, mainly due to the fact that Palpatine believes Vader is conspiring to kill Palpatine. 

Vader, Luke, and Leia eventually make a move on assassinating Palpatine. It was a hard fought battle, but the trio of dark lords overpower Palpatine, and Anakin assumes the throne. 

Here’s where it would get rocky IMO... Vader when he was still a Jedi, displayed a tremendous lack of respect with traditional Jedi codes and ethics. It’s anyone’s guess if he’d respect the Sith’s Rule of Two by exiling either Luke or Leia. He could potentially just keep both of them around, and whatever happens will happen.

Additionally, Vader has displayed an incompetence with politics, and I doubt the Dark Side of the force has the power to give civics lessons. Vader will either need to appoint politicians in the empire’s legislative structure who are loyal to him, or he’s going to have to intimidate Palpatine’s appointees to be loyal. 

This is just my take on the alternate timeline. Constructive criticism is indeed welcomed.",StarWars,1575216571,FuqOffLahey,10,1,True,2019-12-01

My other takeaway from rewatching them all in order has been that Revenge of the Sith is (slightly) underrated. Obviously not without its flaws, but the dialogue, CGI, and shots are significantly better than I and II. Doesn't deserve *quite* as much hate as those two.

question sith,"So for context, I'm a SW fan but I've never delved super deep into the lore. I've read two EU books (a bounty hunter anthology and Shadows of the Empire) and that's about it so my experience is mainly the films. In preparation for ""Skywalker"" in December, I'm rewatching the films and, for the first time, watching the Clone Wars and (eventually) Rebels TV shows. 

My question is this: I was under the impression that the Sith only allowed two, a Master and Apprentice, to exist at one time. If this is true, how are there at least three if not more Sith running around? There's Sidious, Tyrannus, and Ventress (sp) in Clone Wars and does Grievous count as a Sith or he just uses lighsabers? And I know Maul pops up eventually but I know nothing of those circumstances in how he survived Phantom Menace. Or am I wrong in thinking there are only two allowed at a given time?

favor disney mandalorian jedi fallen order spoilers,"Hello there

As a long time SW fan, who owns everything the EU had to offer in its glorious days, I'm also one of those who are not totally against Disney. I mean, it did piss me off they got rid of the EU, but at the same time, I also consider ""Whatever, I chose what pleases me the most to be canon"".

However, the recents Star Wars movies were not, imho, good. Decent, but not good.

But the last month, I surprised myself to REALLY enjoyed The Mandalorian AND Jedi : Fallen Order. Quality is there, yes, and money that's for sure. But I realized WHAT really pleased me in those two new addition to this universe : the element of surprise.

I'm into the fandom and while I'm less than before, I found everything I have to know on the next movie but there was nothing that I found about baby Yoda or Vader's appaerance at the end of FO.

I don't know if Disney leveled up security, or if leakers were found and fired, but this was not how it was before. I knew everything about Rogue One, Solo, the new trilogy with FEW work to find the infos.

And I think the surprise, the excitement of seeing something unexpected, really is one of the major key of why I love Fallen Order and The Mandalorian this much. Not the only one of course, but clearly is a big bonus.

And that is something others could learn from Disney.",StarWars,1575222133,Ciaphas67,15,1,True,2019-12-01

stop complaining fly,"So, before you spam hate comments, let me say what I have to say. Now as you should know, Disney released a 30 second(ish) clip of our protagonists fleeing from First Order jet troopers. C-3PO remarks, ""Oh! They fly now!"" Finn responds with, ""They fly now?"" and Poe responds to that with ""They fly now.""

So, a ton of Star Wars fans are mad about this, and the whole purpose of this post is to convince you why you shouldn't be mad about this.

1. It kinda makes sense for who says it. Now, I kind of wish Finn didn't say it, because he should know about them, but I kind of like it for 3PO and Poe. Now, it works perfectly for 3PO because it's exactly the kind of quippy thing he would say, and for Poe, it's kinda like a ""fuck me, dude.""
2. You shouldn't get mad about a cheesy Star Wars moment. Let me just remind you that this is a series about space wizards fighting evil space empires. This is the series where a giant ball in the sky can blow up a planet. This is the series where there are force ghosts, and little creatures that speak backwards, and so many cheesy yet classic one liners. I mean, look at these! ""Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side kid."" ""Tear this ship apart until you find those plans!"" I mean, this is by no means fabulous writing, and by the trailers, it seems ROS will have its good emotional moments. If you think about it, though, no Star Wars movie has been serious all throughout, not even Rogue One, which is by far the darkest Star Wars movie.
3. It is quite likely this is a pandering clip. For instance, Pixar tends to do this in their trailers: they'll put in their cheesy, little kids movie jokes to make families think it's just an innocent kids movie, and they save the more serious stuff for the movie itself. Take Rogue One for instance. If you want the most people to come, you would probably put out a clip of K2SO saying something funny, like maybe the ""These are prisoners. I am taking them to imprison them... in prison."" You wouldn't show the clip of Cassian shooting the spy or of Saw's rebels killing innocents in their attack, because less parents would take their children to see it.

&amp;#x200B;

So, all in all, I know this clip is not the best, but I wouldn't get too upset over it. These are just my thoughts though, so feel free to comment your opinion.",StarWars,1575222985,1ts_M3_YA_B01,78,1,True,2019-12-01

-Tarfful - Badass wookiee chieftain, active during both the Clone Wars and the Rebellion. Defenitely want to see more from him. 

-Tobias Beckett - Han’s ”mentor” was a pretty interesting character. Would defenitely appreciate seeing more of his exploits.

And Luke became so powerful very fast because there was no light side of the force. The sith were never this powerful without a counter balance. It was the first time only with reigned the galaxy without a resticance from the Jedis. Luke's ability to learn the force very fast comes from this unbalance.

In the Prequels its the same thing. Dark sidious and Palpatine were one of the few siths in a galaxy  with 10.000 jedis. There was a unbalance in the force.

That not all of the dark side is evil.  With this knowledge he kinda broke the cycle.  But we learned he didn't. There were still dark side users. And then there were two powerful jedi. Rey and Luke.

star wars community lost way,"So, I've already pissed a lot of people off with my ""stop complaining about 'they fly now'"" post, so lets stir up some more. 

This community is starting to get really toxic: not this subreddit, but just the whole Star Wars community in general, and this is an issue. Now, I'm not saying I haven't been toxic about things like TLJ, but we really just need to take a moment and think.

So, I was prompted to write this because I watched the ""The Fly Now"" clip and saw just how toxic people were being in the comments, and this is just getting ridiculous. So... it's rant time.

First off: people complaining about ""feminist propaganda"" in Star Wars. Now, I'm sorry, but this is the dumbest shit I have heard in a long time. Now, yes, Holdo was a bad character. I'm saying though that she was made for ""feminist propaganda."" That's dumb. She would have been just as bad of a character if she was a guy. What I'm saying is, she's just a bad character, and a bad female lead. The main thing I'm seeing though is people complaining about Rey, and this really pisses me off. Now first, let me say I am a straight white male, just like most of the assholes complaining about ""feminist propaganda."" It bugs me so much that Rey's character is being passed off by so many fans as a forced female character. Now, one thing I really saw that just drove home how fucking toxic this community is was that on the video I watched of the TFN clip, someone had gotten almost 200 likes from commenting, ""I'm shocked the all powerful Rey missed those blaster shots."" What the actual fuck? And then people are responding with similar comments and this just pisses me off. Remember when Luke just murdered everyone of the guards on Jabba's barge and then escaped when he had had his hands bound? No one complained about that. Remember when with no jedi training, Luke blindly fired missles into the Death Star and blew it up? No one complained about that. Yet of course, Rey's an absolute Mary Sue according to half the fan base, it seems, because she was able to kick Kylo Ren's ass and mind trick a stormtrooper. First, let me talk about this. So, Kylo is not even a full fledged sith. He killed almost everyone at his jedi summercamp before he finished training, and since Snoke is so disfigured in 7 and 8, I doubt he was able to really physically train Kylo. So, Kylo is sloppy. He's a bit stronger by Rey, but he's still running off of hate. He got injured by Finn and had been shot by a fucking bowcaster which packed enough force to send that one stormtrooper flying, whereas Rey is pretty much unscathed, and has also been surviving as a scavenger for years, so she already has some melee skills as shown earlier in the film, and she's built up a lot more resilience then Luke would have had as nothing but a farm hand. That combined with the force, and yeah. Her beating him makes sense, especially since his connection to the dark side is likely afflicted since in TFA book, he does regret killing his father and it leaves him feeling empty and confused. Now, I can't explain the mind trick as well, but if the little shit Ezra Bridger pulled it off on, like, attempt three, her getting it on attempt two is reasonable enough.

Now, the second part of my rant is that people are just really taking these movies for granted. Now, I'm saying there all good. TLJ is very much a hovertrain wreck and Solo is just bland. The thing is though, without Disney, we'd only have 6 Star Wars movies, only about 3 of which were really good (ANH, ESB, and ROTS since I think people have mixed emotions on ROTJ, though it's definitely not bad). I mean, the others didn't suck (flashbacks of Jar Jar Binks), okay, one of them sucked, but still. We only had 6 movies. Then, Disney bought Lucasfilm, and now we have 10 movies, with and 11th releasing in a few weeks. Are all of these good? No, but some of them are. I stand by my statement that Rogue One is the best Star Wars movie, go ahead and at me. TFA is a cut and paste of ANH, but still feels fresh enough, and definitely isn't a masterpiece, but is a fun film to watch. TLJ is a train wreck, but can be ironically enjoyed, and still has some good moments, like that kick ass fight with the Praetorian Guards or the lightspeed ram, or even the bombing run (if you take out the your mom joke). Solo is the worst of the bunch, since it's not bad enough to be ironically enjoyed nor good enough to be actually enjoyed, but you can still have fun with a large group. Plus, these films are the reason we get shows like The Mandalorian or Clone Wars season 7, both of which are fanboy wet dreams. Even the worse shows, like Rebels and maybe Resistance (is it bad, I haven't watched it) are still watchable, and even Rebels has some really enjoyable episodes, as much as it pains me to admit it, like Future of the Force. We wouldn't have the two new Battlefronts (even though they aren't great) or Jedi Fallen Order. I'm not saying you have to like these movies, and I'm not saying they're all good, but they're still Star Wars movies, ones we can still enjoy. Plus, because of this, we may get a second Lego Star Wars The Complete Saga.

So, again, you don't have to like these films, and if you hate them, that's fine. That's your opinion. This is mine, though, and I just think this community needs to be a little more grateful for these films, that's all. Thanks for reading this, is you have something to say, all I ask is that you're polite.

I just believe it's a better format for the franchise. With a T.V show, they can actually draw out the plot. They don't have to rush anything like a few movies. They also have more creative control since it's the show. Not the movie which are cash cows so they have to be marketed to the biggest audience possible.

Feels like the '90s with DC. They didn't really make any buzzworthy Batman/Superman movies during that decade but their animated shows Superman the Animated Series, Batman the Animated Series and Batman Beyond were phenomenal.

midichlorian origin story,"Incoming text wall. I’m bored on a long car ride so here goes nothing. 

So I’ve been thinking about an idea for a Star Wars tv show that could explain midichlorians in a better light. I know how many people hate the concept of them, but personally, I don’t. What I do hate is the lack of clarity surrounding them. I think an origin story explaining them could be an exciting step for the series. Here’s my extremely rough concept of what it could look like.

Background: The rebels and Republic exist to an extent. There are lightsaber wielders without force capabilities along with some clones, and an alliance acting opposite of them with droids as well as their own saber wielders. Again, the force is not present. Both are in the early stages of their respective orders, and they lack many of the formal rules that we know of in the series. 

Opening

A man with dual wielded white light sabers is terrorizing a village so he can complete a bounty and supply for himself. Eyes glowing white as he destroys everything in his path. Dashing from enemy to enemy with a flash of white light trailing him, so fast that no one can react by the time he is ready to kill them. He finally reaches his target to find that the republic beat him there. Both impressed and scared, the emperor of the republic offers an alliance with the young man, whose name is revealed to be Midas. He will get to collect the bounty, but he will pledge his services to the republic. A mutual agreement is in place, and Midas accepts. 

bonds are made through filler episodes 

Now, season wrapping up, and the emperor’s plan is becoming apparent. He wants to find a way to harness the power found in Midas. Eventually, he convinces Midas to get in a contraption of his, something that emperor promises will enhance Midas’ control of his powers. What actually happens is the emperor drains energy from Midas, discards him into outer space, and jumps to light speed with the newfound energy (first time its ever done???). 
Midas, whose veins are glowing white, is left stranded and alone.

Season end

The Jedi find him, but are sure that he’s dead. To their surprise, he’s got a heart beat and his veins remain glowing. In time, he regains consciousness. They listen to his story, and express sympathy and a desire for Midas to join them. Wary but desperate, he obliges in an attempt to lower their guard so he can escape. He fails as he’s far too weak to attempt such a feat. 

Midas begins training with the Jedi, who he still distrusts, and this feeling is now mutual. They too are intrigued by the power he radiates, but this only furthers Midas away from them as he is confident they will do the same as the republic. However, Midas recognizes that this is his best chance to regain his strength, so he continues. As his powers grow, the Jedi’s interest does as well. They send him through rigorous trials to see the true scope of his abilities. They go too far, sending Midas to the brink of death. While most Jedi call for the trial to stop, the leader refuses. He believes Midas can overcome it with ease, and he says that it is “all coming together nicely.” This sets Midas off, as he is confident the Jedi have bad intentions for him. However, he still has the current trial he needs to complete, and contrary to what the Jedi leader believes, Midas is truly outmatched. His heart is racing, fear is mounting, and the nerves set off a reaction in Midas. His eyes glow again for the first time since the cold open. His veins follow suit. His entire body is engulfed in white aura as a burst of energy radiates from him. It is so powerful that it kills the beast chasing him, but the blast extends well beyond that and kills multiple Jedi masters. The Jedi leader is absolutely thrilled to see this display of power, but thrill quickly turns to anger when he realizes that Midas has escaped. He commands the Jedi order to chase Midas. The Jedis turn on their leader, killing him, as they are enraged that their allies had to die because of one mans hunger for power. This is enhanced by the fact that many Jedi expressed worry about Midas and his intentions. A new commander steps up as the Jedi make a plan to catch Midas and avenge their fallen comrades. 

Season end

The new season opens with the blast once more, but this time from Midas’ perspective. He flees the scene as the Jedi are too encumbered with the fallout of the blast. He finds a ship at the Jedi base and flees the planet. Many people see him along the way, but not knowing of what just happened, they think nothing of it. He flees to his home planet to find his mother and get to safety. The Jedi, on their hunt for Midas, ask around the base of his whereabouts, and a lead is able to pinpoint the exact ship he left on. They track it and follow Midas to his home planet. A massive Jedi fleet leaves, large enough to peak the interest of the republic, who have spies across the galaxy. They await to see what the Jedi are after, and they hatch a plan to ambush the order. 

Midas arrives on his planet and returns home. His mother is in shock to see him. Midas explains that people are after him. He simply wants to get him and his mom to safety and escape to the outer rim of the galaxy. His mom assures him that all is well and that he’s far too powerful to be worrying about this. Midas asks why he’s been gifted with such a power, one that he’s never seen anyone else have. His mom says that even she can’t say, and that only his father would be able to tell him. Sadly, she doesn’t know of his location. They must develop a plan to try and pinpoint Midas’ dad. Mom comes up with some leads, some old friends of Dad’s. His dad’s old ship is still at home, and Midas takes this as Midas goes looking across the galaxy for his father. He leaves shortly before the Jedi fleet arrives on his planet. A search ensues for the lost ship, which they find at his mother’s residence. Unwilling to give up any information on her son, the Jedi take her as prisoner where they plan to torture for information. While they bring her back to their main ship, the republic ambush arrives. They slaughter the Jedi on the planet as well as the entire village Midas comes from. They leave their mark in its center. His mom is one of the last to survive, and the republic leader questions her because she was obviously of interest to the Jedi. She refuses to speak, and the emperor decapitates her without second thought. He had already got what he came for: the jedi. 

Midas gathers the information he needs on his father over the season, and returns to his planet to tell mom of the intel he has. Home is a wasteland. Everything is destroyed, nobody is alive. He checks his old home to find it completely demolished. Searching for his mother, he finds a headless body that he can’t for sure say is hers. Walking a bit further, he finds her severed head. His eyes begin to glow a feint white as his face takes on a demonic expression. The camera zooms on his face, and slowly, his white eyes transition into a binary moon in the night sky. 

Season end

The season opens with that same binary moon, and it is obvious that Midas is on a new planet where he is in refuge. Basking in the moonlight is Midas, confused, angry, and scared. He goes to a forest nearby to vent his frustration, unleashing on any and everything he can find. He loses control of his own rage, resulting in a burst similar to the one that leveled the Jedi. The empire catches this massive energy signature on a radar of theirs and look to investigate. The emperor theorizes that the only thing that could radiate such power is Midas, much to the surprise of the council, who assumes he is dead. The emperor wants to finish the job and drain the rest of Midas’ newfound power for his own gain.

I have no idea how the rest of the season would go. I’d want the father to have information on Midas, but I don’t have a good idea for the origin of his powers yet. I do have an idea for an ending however, which would be

Republic finally tracks down Midas. A spy comes to his father’s house to confirm they are right of his whereabouts. This peaks Midas’ curiosity, and he tells his father that he thinks something is not right. They try to flee the planet but it’s too late, the empire has already surrounded Midas’ fathers’ house. Midas tells his father that they are either both surviving or neither of them are, but mid sentence, the emperor has the father shot in the head and killed. He says that he wants to get this over with quick, and that it would be best for all parties involved if Midas hands himself over. Midas is overtaken by fury, and his eyes and veins begin pulsing white as he demolishes the republic fleet by dashing and slashing. Eventually he is overpowered by the sheer number of foes. The emperor is gloating of his victory as the white glow overtakes Midas’ whole body, and this thrills the emperor. As he tells Midas all the things he will do with the power he harnesses from him, the camera zooms on Midas’ eyes as they begin to shine a blinding white, and the energy contained in Midas completely bursts in a blast that levels the planet, destroying the republic. The camera pans to the epicenter, which is now a white hole (think a black hole but white) and the floating matter in space begins to collapse into this. A second explosion happens, this one on the scale of the Big Bang. The remaining Jedi, who are in exile at the newly built Jedi temple, hear news of the republic’s demise and investigate. They reach the spot of the explosion, and they find a white, pulsing ball at its center. They recognize the glow and pulse as a result of Midas’ power, and the radiation they are exposed to makes them the first force sensitive people in the galaxy. They call the resulting energy from the blast midichlorians, in honor of their source, Midas. The midichlorians are shown spreading throughout the galaxy, and it shows that they imbue themselves into any new life that the universe harbors.

episode ix theory,"I’d like to preface this theory by saying that this is pure speculation. THERE ARE NO EPISODE IX SPOILERS. Also, in case you’re wondering, I liked the Force Awakens and I did not like the Last Jedi. If that turns you away from reading this, that’s fine. All-in-all, I’d still say I love Star Wars. My theory is basically comparing the structure of the Star Wars movies with that of the Metal Gear Solid games. If you don’t know Metal Gear Solid then this might not make sense to you. If The original trilogy is the first Metal Gear Solid game then that would make Luke the parallel to Solid Snake and Liquid/Big Boss basically represents Darth Vader because they’re Snake’s main antagonists. Solid Snake has to infiltrate an Island off the coast of Alaska to rescue several of the government’s top R&amp;D authorities. He also has to shut down a nuclear weapon called Metal Gear Rex. This is call the Incident on Shadow Moses. Snake becomes his most resourceful, destroys the Metal Gear and strays away from becoming a mindless weapon and starts to fight independently, driven by his own sense of right and wrong. 
Luke, throughout the original trilogy, becomes a Jedi Knight. Learning about a power than can bring peace to the galaxy, turns his father back to the Light, destroys 2 planet-killing weapons called Death Stars and defeats the empire. Luke then has a duty to carry on the legacy of the Jedi to ensure that evil does not rise again. Luke is unquestionably in his prime after the events of Return of the Jedi while Snake is in his prime after the events of Shadow Moses. 
Moving on to Metal Gear Solid 2. A new Foxhound agent, code name Raiden, is assigned to rescue the president from a group of terrorists who threaten the world with a new and improved version of the weapon from the first game. This one’s called Metal Gear Ray. These terrorists occupy a US oil rig called “Big Shell” and are lead by the former President and third brother of the twin Snakes, Solidus Snake. Throughout the course of the game, you’re meant to slowly realize that this game’s order of events play out very similarly to the events of Shadow Moses. Right down to the Father/Som relationship between Raiden and Solidus. Similar to Snake and Big Boss. Also very similar to Luke and Darth Vader. Raiden ends up destroying the Metal Gear, defeating his father, and learning the same lessons Snake learned. Except this time, this game being so similar to the first game was intentional. The secret villain behind the events of both games, Revolver Ocelot, reveals that the events of this game, called the Big Shell incident, we’re all orchestrated by a secret force called the Patriots. The Patriots are the same people who cloned Big Boss to create the Snake brothers, Solid, Liquid, and Solidus. But because all three of these clones broke away from the Patriot’s control and fought for their own free will, the Patriots turned to a different method of creating a successor to the greatest soldier who ever lived. Instead of genetic cloning, they wanted to clone a series of events that drove Solid Snake to become such a good soldier, putting Raiden through this “Solid Snake Simulation”. The difference between Raiden and Snake is that Snake did not a man to drive him toward doing what’s right instead of what you’re told. Raiden found that mentor in Solid Snake himself when they met on Big Shell. So the Patriot’s plans are foiled, and they go into hiding until Solid Snake spends 5 years tracking them down and that’s where Metal Gear Solid 4 takes place.
I’m sure you might see where I’m going with this. Rey is a new force-sensitive, wide eyed, adventure-seeking, young adult. She is thrown into a fight against the First Order, similar to how Luke was thrown into his fight against the Empire. Rey has to help the Resistance destroy a planet-killing weapon called Starkiller base which that is newer and bigger, similar to how Metal Gear Ray was bigger and better than Metal Gear Rex. Starkiller base is destroyed, and Rey goes in search for Luke. After Luke is relunctant to help revive the Jedi religion, Rey goes back to the Resistance, ready to fight Kylo Ren. They kill the Supreme Leader (a parallel to the Emperor of the original trilogy). But this time, Kylo Ren is not converted like Vader was. Rey gets away and the film ends with the Resistance on the run and Kylo Ren chasing after them. 
For this theory to make sense, we’d have to look at the original trilogy as the events of Metal Gear Solid 1 and look at Force Awakens and Last Jedi as the events of Metal Gear Solid 2. Mainly because Metal Gear Solid 4 is the conclusion to the story similar to how Episode IX is. Plus is seems that Rey already went through the full arch in two movies that  Luke had taken 3 movies to get through. 
So my theory is based on the events that play out in Metal Gear Solid 4, with a shadowy force that has been behind everything that has transpired since the events of the “first one” (“first one” meaning Metal Gear Solid 1 and A New Hope, respectively). The mysterious force in Metal Gear was the Patriots and the mysterious force of Star Wars is Emperor Palpatine. I believe Palpatine orchestrated the events of the Force Awakens and The Last Jedi. He was a puppet master, controlling Snoke and, by extension, Kylo Ren. He wanted a new Luke Skywalker through Rey. The best way to do that would be to put Rey through the same events as A New Hope. It would retcon why The Force Awakens was so similar to A New Hope and there’s no shame doing this even if it wasn’t planned because it doesn’t seem like Kojima planned on making the Patriots as powerful as they ended up being in MGS4. We even had prequels for both stories. In the Star Wars prequels we saw the rise of the Empire and how the Emperor gained that much power. We saw Anakin fall to the dark side and become the most feared Sith Lord in the galaxy. In Metal Gear Solid 3, we saw how Major Zero obtained the means to create the Patriots and drove the greatest soldier of all time, Big Boss, into being a feared war-criminal.
This may just be wishful thinking because personally I’d like this to be true. But mainly because I love Star Wars and Metal Gear Solid so much.",StarWars,1575236968,Placito0108,2,1,True,2019-12-01

,"My 7 year old son found this in his Star Wars advent calendar, who is it?",StarWars,1575237533,Terstiary,0,1,True,2019-12-01
thinking tlj lately,"So in anticipation for TRoS I’ve been looking back at previous Star Wars movies. It’s been nearly 2 years and I am surprised to see that people still hate The Last Jedi. Like; a lot. Personally, I don’t get it. The movie has its problem for sure and I wouldn’t call it my favorite Star Wars movie, but I like it because it is different. So while keeping things civil, I would like to share my opinions. I invite anyone to either agree or disagree with me, and politely say why you feel this way.

First off I want to address how some people say that the prequels are better than this movie. I really have to disagree with this. While I do have some nostalgia for the prequels, and I appreciate what they have contributed to the overall Star Wars canon, on a technical level, the prequels are far worse than TLJ. There is already a lot of talk about the prequels so I’ll just say that I find the scripts, editing, pacing, and the overuse of CGI in the prequels to be more offensive than TLJ . I don’t hate the prequels like some do but I can see from a filmmaking perspective that the prequels are of less quality and honesty really bad at points. That’s not to say that the last Jedi doesn’t have its own problems. But the movie looks good, the acting is good. There is a use of practical effects and cgi and the movie just feels like it is put together well.

One of the biggest complaints I have seen is the handling of Luke in this movie and the way the force is used. Funnily enough, these are my favorite parts. I love the idea of Luke being flawed. It makes sense for his character. He has never been perfect. In the beginning he was a little arrogant and impatient and whenever he became a Jedi he still struggled to balance his emotions. We see this in RoTJ and then again in TLJ. Luke fears becoming like his father, so whenever he ultimately creates Kylo Ren because of his own mistakes (like his father he let emotions take control of him), he feels that it is best for him to just abandon the Jedi lifestyle entirely. Because of what he did, he does not feel like the hero he is though to be. The idea of the all the Skywalkers being flawed individuals is something that I find to be really interesting.  And I really do not have a problem with the way the force is used I’m this movie. It adds some interesting ideas and concepts that we usually have to look outside the movies to find.

Let’s talk Snoke. At first, I was disappointed too. Don’t get me wrong, I thought his death was really surprising and I really didn’t see it coming. After watching it for the first time, I thought that they just wasted his character. But now that I think about it, I’m kinda glad they  killed him off the way they did. Hear me out. While I still think getting a backstory down the line for snoke would be cool, I really think that if he was kept around he would’ve just been another Emperor. A super powerful force user that wants control of the galaxy. Is this a bad thing? Not necessarily. But I think it might’ve been disappointing. I’d just rather have something new than something a little too similar. Maybe he would’ve turned out to be a compelling character. But the way I see it, we are two movies into a trilogy and we are barely now getting to know this character. Meanwhile we have villains like Kylo Ren who have been more developed. I just think it would be hard to fear someone who had been relatively faceless for most of the trilogy.  I dunno that’s just my take on it.

Now the whole Rey being a Mary Sue....this is something that Star Wars has always had. Anakin was born out of the force, happened to be very gifted in the force, and just happened to be an amazing pilot. Luke, like his father, also conveniently happens to be gifted in the force. Granted, the prequels help explain why he is, but if you look at the first Star Wars as it’s own thing, then it is just kinda convenient for him to be so in tune with the force. So is Rey a Mary Sue? Maybe sometimes she is. But the movies already show that she is familiar with ships because she is always scavenging them for parts and she’s already know how to fight a little bit because  she had to defend herself her entire life. There are also many cases in Star Wars where people use the force without prior training. And for the people who think this movie is still some piece of propaganda, there is absolutely nothing wrong with a woman being the hero/main character. Absolutely nothing. Also her not being related to anyone is ok. Yeah it’s unexpected but at the end of the day if she was related to anyone we already knew, the universe would just feel a little smaller.

Now let’s be honest, this movie can be a little odd. Not all the humor lands, Finn doesn’t really feel like an interesting character to me, Canto Bight ultimately seemed pointless and so on. However, these things do not make the movie terrible. It’s flawed, yes. But what movie isn’t flawed? Rouge One is really flawed in terms of having characters that I actually care about, but I still like that movie. Perhaps TRoS will make things in TLJ make more sense. We will just have to wait and see. Like I said, I’d like to hear everybody’s opinions and explanations as to why they did  or  didn’t like this movie.  Be friendly guys. I’m just a guy sharing his opinions.",StarWars,1575237819,Crazedllama5,79,1,True,2019-12-01

anyone else underwhelmed mandalorian,"Before I start, I know this is going to get a lot of negative criticism but I am really just curious on what the community thinks without all of the PR and promoted blog posts. 

I want to be on the hype train and be all about all the new content but I was really expecting more from this.  I love the Mandos character but there’s only so much story building you can do with 8 episodes that are around a half hour long.  I was expecting the production level to be on par with West Workd, Watchmen, and Game of Thrones.  I like the references to the rest of the Star Wars universe like the Lothal cats and Jawas but I don’t know it’s really not what I was expecting.  The first 2 episodes I felt a lot of the scenes with Kuiil were really cheesy and predictable in terms of music and the way their relationship evolved.  The scene with Mando killing the horned beast with a small knife was pretty ridiculous though it was cool to see that the child is force sensitive and powerful.  

The scenes underground of the remnants of mandalore are really cool.  There’s definitely aspects of it that I like plus the potential of having some interplay with the cloning station on Kamino for the young yoda species.  I’m really hoping for the best.  

What are your thoughts?  Is this what you wanted?  Do you think 8 half hours episodes from the first half of the season is projected to live up the $100M spent?  I keep comparing it to other high budget TV series and the potential is there but I don’t think they are doing it in the right way.  I like that it’s different but in a way I feel a lot of it is hollow, rushed, or predictable. 

As a disclaimer, I’ve seen all the movies, clone wars, rebels, and resistance that are out.  I read as many of the canon books as I can though I haven’t finished them all.",StarWars,1575238041,o-rka,16,1,True,2019-12-01

rankings movies,"I am very curious about the communities thoughts on the films and movies. Like what are your favorites or your least favorites and why? If you do rank them worst to best and this can include all the movies like the clone wars movies and such not just the main 9. Obviously just do whatever ones you have seen. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Mine list (worst to best) is: 

\-**Phantom Menace:** I just really hate this movie it is so boring and just ugh. Cannot stand it (except the final battle with Darth Maul). I really do not like the young Anakin actor tbh, I did not think he was good and overall the movie was just not a good entry into the franchise. Most of the time I skip this movie on my rewatching just because it is so unbearable. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-**Attack of the Clones**: Honestly the only redeeming thing about this movie is the few lightsaber battles but the acting is unbearable and Anakin is such an unbearable character to watch. I do love the Geonosis scene and seeing the Jedi Order attack and work together as it really is the only time we see most of them there. It was awesome and obviously the final fight is amazing. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-**Clone Wars Movie**: This is a decent movie but there is not much to say after that. It is a hot mess and does not have many redeeming qualities other than the introduction of the fan-favorite character Ahsoka (whom I love very much).

 

 \-**Rogue One:** I did not love this movie but I did not hate it either. It is alright but its plot just was not for me. I found it to be a story that did not really need to be told but it was still welcome. I do love the ending with Leia and Darth Vader so it makes it worth watching just for that. Also, the scene with the Star Destroyer crashing into the other one is pretty cool. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-**Last Jedi:** I really do not get the hate of this movie. It is not the best but I do think its pretty good and a solid entry into the series and I know it is flawed but it is not as bad as everyone else makes it seem. I know that the casino shit was not needed and a waste but I love what they did with Rey and Ben the entire connection was amazing and the scenes were done well. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-**Revenge of the Sith**: Anakin is somewhat more likable of a character but still pretty unbearable for the most part however the entire scene on Mustafar is what redeems this movie. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-**A New Hope:** This is my least favorite of the originals. It is not bad but it is not as great as everyone makes it seem. However, it is a groundbreaking movie that really was influential and changed Hollywood for the better.    

&amp;#x200B;

\-**Solo:** I actually loved this movie and I am very sad it bombed in the box office. I do hope they make the planned sequels because Solo was a really great movie that I really enjoyed watching. Han is not my favorite character (that goes to Princess Leia) but he is up there and I do really enjoy watching his early journeys. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-**Empire Strikes Back:** I do like this movie. No really specific reason at all just like it a lot. It was a pretty good entry and just overall a solid movie. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-**The Force Awakens:** I LOVE this movie. I do not give a shit what anyone says this is an excellent movie. JJ did such an amazing job and it honestly reminded me a lot of the originals and gave me just the same feeling like I was watching them again. I am looking forward towards Rise of Skywalker just because Abrams is back in the director and writer seat and he will fix the many messes of Last Jedi. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-**Return of the Jed**i: I love this movie so much. It really is amazing. I have 0 complaints about this movie. The final act just everything about Return of the Jedi was AMAZING for me.",StarWars,1575242731,KingBlackthorn1,53,1,True,2019-12-01

kylo reflection millennial generation maybe hope ends hero slightly casual fan extremely well versed lure freely admit could wrong,"‪Controversial perhaps, and biased: but perhaps Kylo is to date the most relatable character in SW, especially for the millennial generation🤔 And maybe this is why myself, and perhaps others hope he turns out to be a hero and redeemed like Vader, just different paths.

My argument:

1- Kylo has had a start like a lot of this generation. His start was not as obviously despairing as Anakin’s who grew up a slave, but it was rather a more grey and confusing start to life. His difficulties were present, but they were things in simple where he faced constant hardships and confusion. Much like many face these days (student debt, high divorce rate, etc.) instead of full outright war like Vietnam in the older generations (granted that was present too, but not at the same level)

2-Kylo strives to be good, and I believe it is clear through many of the interactions he has had with Rey, and his redeeming act of killing Snoke (which I don’t believe was purely for power). Kylo struggles with this because he has become so confused, much like our generation where morals are commonly unclear or not discussed. To support this the world in the Sequels is less Evil vs Bad outright, for we even see Finn tormented by what is happening and changing allegiance. This could also be far-fetched but having it been referenced that Snoke bent his mind could relate to the General society we have today where bad actions are often endorsed (not stating any political stance or example, just an observation)

3- Kylo looks for something to ground his moral compass, he looks towards the tradition of his grandfather, who ruled and in a way brought his own order to the galaxy. Kylo realizes at times or at least shows his doubts outright in supporting the Dark side, yet he is estranged and discouraged in a way because of his upbringing- i.e. Luke drawing his lightsaber on him and his family often gone.

I truly hope and believe he will redeem himself completely by the end. And please take mercy on my tired and biased thoughts, I just want to see if anyone shares this view or has a different outlook, which I would love to hear!",StarWars,1575249172,Baldmanfondu1,16,1,True,2019-12-01
bother anyone else canon stories outside movies always end irrelevant big picture,"For example, Fallen Order ends with the Empire not getting their hands on a holocron...they already didn’t have. The status quo for galaxy doesn’t change at all. What about Cal Kestis, who is a solidly competent and powerful Jedi by the end of the game. Are we supposed to assume he died before the Rebellion properly got on its feet? Because otherwise, he would have been a pretty powerful asset to their cause. 

Back in the Legends/EU era, characters would become insanely powerful (ex. Kyle Katarn) and it made sense why the larger canon would ignore them. But now with the streamlined Disney canon I wish they would do more to make these side stories feel impactful and relevant. 

The only case where this doesn’t bother me is The Mandalorian, because so far it’s a very entertaining self-contained story, and as Baby Yoda would still be very young at the time of TFA, I really don’t expect to see him influence the larger canon anytime soon.

But a very powerful and attractive temptress seducing a young man to the Dark Side? Gotta be honest, way more believable, and creates a different angle we haven't seen in the Star Wars films before. A force user who is seduced by a master of the dark side, not only because of the power it offers, but because he falls foolishly and madly in love with her. 

Instead we get some guy who was The Emperor 2.0, until they offed him in the second film without much explanation as to who he is and where he comes from, only for then to make way for Palpatine to come back.

realized george vision,"Watching the Star Wars documentary on Amazon made me realize a few things:
1. Disney just doesn't get Star Wars. At least not satisfyingly or completely. Yes, the movies are overall very good, but I always felt there was a certain flair missing and a big piece of the soul that stayed with George. Sometimes Disney's methodology and image gets in the way of them taking calculated risks and going beyond for their audience. Sometimes the fandom misses the point and goes too far. There is a balance to be found.
2. George got caught up in so much that it detracted from so many things of the prequel trilogy, which still isn't all that bad. He had great vision though.
3. The original trilogy wasn't just lightning in a bottle. There was a single fluid vision that was stayed true to and fulfilled through immense hardships. They honed their skills and their ideas to make it work. There is something to learn from perseverance and level-headedness in the face of strain and hardship.
4. Kathleen Kennedy is just not up to chuff. She is a glorified executive that is too self-concious and unseasoned to handle the studio. Yes, she has made countless classics as a producer and knows the production, but her role behind the desk does not seem to be suiting her well or the vision of Star Wars. George even understood where to step back and step in on the original trilogy.

jedi incompetence,"I've been watching the clone wars.  Am I the only one who sees how incompetent the jedi are.  Here are just a few examples

1. Sending cruisers to look for the malevolence when A squad of fighters could do the same thing without putting nearly as many people in danger.  Plus they are more maneuverable and could probably get out of the way.
2. Not using their hyperdrives to surround the malevolence instead just chasing it.  The first order made this same mistake in the last jedi.
3. Showing up in cruisers and then launching fighters when it would be quicker to just have the fighters drop out of hyperspace close to separatist ships.
4. Trying to land clones in ships that are slow instead of having them free fall and use jetpacks or parachutes to slow down.
5. landing clones on the ground when they have a fleet of ships in orbit that can level the planet from space.
6. Using shields someone can just walk through.  Although the separatists do this too.  
7. Not using hyperspace ramming.  Although the separatists didn't do this either.  The only time you see hyperspace ramming is when the malevolence crashes into that moon.

a quick chronological history of force ghosting in the movies: Obi-wan's jedi master Qui-Gon-jinn learns the method of preserving your consciousness in the force, able to be seen at will by others, or maybe just force-sensitives. he dies, and doesn't appear until obi-wan and anakin visit the force-bathed planet Mortis, where obi talks to his long dead master, believing it to be a deception. 

near the end of the clone wars, qui shows himself to yoda, and tells him of how to learn this trick himself. it is presumed that before they split paths during **Revenge** yoda taught Obi-wan how to force ghost.

this leads to one problem. no one who knew how to force ghost at the time could or were willing to contact Vader during the almost 20 years between **Revenge** and **A New Hope** or any of the original trilogy for that matter. Ani couldn't have learned of force ghosting, because it is a light-side only power, and he had no capacity or drive to learn it.",StarWars,1572593496,SubjectChanger1,22,3,True,2019-11-01

tattoo help,"Hey guys, I’m starting the planning for my Star Wars tattoo, I have wanted it for years but have been up in the air on what to actually get.  I wanted some sort of sleeve, at first I thought a full sleeve with a realistic style so it would be full coverage, I’ve moved on from that because I think personally it’s too much for me.  So I thought half sleeve with realistic style but my tattoo artist and I had a conversation about how the realization especially on faces needs to be a certain size and since there is so much and so many characters I wanted to incorporate a half sleeve wouldn’t work either.

So I went back to planning, and I have since switched back to a full sleeve but in the traditional style (think old pinup/sailor tattoos).  My plan is to get each character I want with a memorable quote in banners around the character.  Then as filler in between the characters use the outline of ships and blasters as well as lightsabers to tie it all together.  Which brings me to where I need all of your help.  I’m having trouble pulling the trigger on certain characters and the quotes I want to use for them,  so I am going to list the characters I want with the quote I’m thinking and maybe you guys can give me your favorite quotes as well to help make my decision! 

Han-never tell me the odds
Leia-you’re my only hope
Like-the force is strong in my family
Obi-wan/old Ben(not sure which to use)-hello there(also unsure)
Emperor-unsure of the quote
Lando- what have we here
Yoda-do or do not, there is no try(tough one for me to pick)
Ackbar-it’s a trap
Vader-I am your father
Tarkin-you May fire when ready
Jabba-bo shudda
Maybe Darth maul-at last we will have our revenge
R2 and chewy will be in it but I don’t think I am going to put a quote with either of them
C3po-this is madness


This is where I’m at so far, some characters might not make the final product depending on spacing and everything.  Any input you guys can give or maybe if I forgot a character which I’m sure I did, you guys can help!  I’m not doing any from the sequels, not bc I dislike them but I just feel they are too new to commit to putting them on my skin.

multi person starfighters anyone,"Some of you will remember me from some posts similar to this one, where I asked people what Imperial or Rebellion ship they'd want to command. Now I'm asking you this: what starfighter with a crew greater than one would you want to pilot? (You could be a gunner or some other position if you wanted.) Also, astromechs or other droids like them don't count as crew. They're just good to have on a starfighter.

Personally, I would take a BTL-S8 K-wing assault starfighter. Sure, it doesn't have a hyperdrive, but it does have a SLAM system, so that's really useful. It also has one medium-range twin laser cannon turret, one short-range quad turbolaser turret, 18 hardpoints for bombs, missiles, sensors, cargo, or even *more* guns. Even without using the hardpoints, it can carry concussion missiles, proton torpedoes, plasma torpedoes, flechette missiles, and, occasionally, advanced homing missiles, ion bombs, and even conner nets. Plus, even with all that weaponry, it only takes 4 crew: a pilot, a bombardier, and 2 gunners. Who wouldn't want that?",StarWars,1572614645,OriginalSchmill,13,5,True,2019-11-01

artoo scared,"Now, I know that George Lucas didn't have the story of Prequels thought out yet so I don't need these comments. I'm looking for thoughts on potential in-universe explanations. 

There's a lot of discussion on Obi Wan saying ""I don't recall ever owning a droid"" and why Artoo never tells Luke about his past but I don't think anyone has ever discussed why Artoo is scared when Obi Wan shows up. 

My first thought was it's more play-acting he does to help sell the ""I don't know anything about the past"" line he's been feeding Luke with. But Luke is out cold. For this to make sense Artoo is Daniel Day Lewis level method acting. 

About the only other idea I can think of is Artoo doesn't recognize him. But surely Artoo knew him well enough to recognize the guy after 19 years. 

Plus Artoo has never been scared anytime else. He told right out on the wing if Padmes ship while droid fighters are lighting it up. Flies around a giant droid factory all chill asf. He fights off buzz droids and mercs a hangar full of battle droid. Pics a fight with Yoda when he grabs Luke's lamp. Zaps Salacious Crumb. 

Also somewhat related, Artoo's mission is so important that he tricks Luke into removing his restraining bolt and took off as soon as he can but he hardly reacts when Ben says that he is Obi Wan and then just calmly sits there through the whole Anakin story and patiently waits for Obi Wan to see what Artoo's deal is.",StarWars,1572632398,bumpjon,11,2,True,2019-11-01
thing mary sue star wars,"Probably been posted before but the hate for the ST and TLJ in particular makes no sense to me, especially this favorite of talking points. 

Every bit of Rey’s abilities and growth are addressed and established by the movies if you’d care to pay attention:

1) she’s been on her own on Jakku for most of her life, defending herself with the bow staff. She can handle melee weapons. It’s not unexpected that after Kylo Ren was shot by a goddam Wookiee bow caster, which has been shown to thrown people back yards, that Rey would be able to keep up and defeat him. 

2) people in the Star Wars universe know what Jedi mind tricks are. Watto knows what they are. Jabba knows what they are. The exploits of Luke Skywalker have been mythologized, and Rey, after hearing that all those stories are real, decides to try. 

3) but, but, that’s advanced and she has no training! TLJ shows broom boy at the end calling his broom. Kids that are force sensitive play with their abilities from young ages. It’s possible and not at all unlikely that Rey has actually used the mind trick before with or without actually realizing what she was doing. 

4) she has first hand knowledge of the Falcon’s inner workings because THAT’S WHAT SHE DOES. It’s clearly established that not only does she scavenge for parts, but she works on ships for Unkar Plut (sp?). She also would be testing them in this capacity. So yeah, she’s pulling crazy maneuvers in them, but Abrams has a script in front of him that says Rey and Finn escape in the Falcon while being chased by tie fighters. He’s got a few choices about how to show that chase. That he chose to have them race through a fallen star destroyer and pull some difficult maneuvers only serves to provide excitement for the audience, something I’d expect for an action space fantasy. If your problem is how crazy the maneuvers are, you’re focusing on surface level detail that doesn’t detract from the story at all, and provides what a Star Wars movie should be providing. 

5) Luke explicitly says that Rey and Kylo both possess the strongest raw powers in the Force he’s ever encountered. Snoke says Darkness rises and Light to meet. Clearly the Force itself is playing a role in both Rey and Kylo’s abilities. It’s balancing itself. You know, like that prophecy about which Yoda himself says: A prophecy that misread, could be. Which leads to...

6) Luke and Anakin both pull off impossible tasks with no training whatsoever. Luke makes a one in a million shot to destroy the Death Star (rogue leader, you know, their best pilot, fails to make the shot; everyone says it’s impossible) and pulls his lightsaber from the snow without ever having seen anything like that before. Anakin destroys a goddam neimoidian control ship with little more than an oopsie daisy. If Rey is OP, then so are Anakin and Luke, but we accept them, why? Perhaps because you should know what you’re getting into when you see a SW flick. If you don’t carry a little suspension of disbelief into the theater with you, you’re gonna have a bad time as the whole thing falls apart. But you know it’s fantasy, so you allow things to exist for the sake of the human stories being told at the heart of the matter. This isn’t hard science fiction. There’s no gravity in space so the bombs can’t fall from the bombers, but who really cares about these things? The logistics of hyperspace kamikaze attacks? This shit doesn’t matter to the story. Rey’s abilities don’t matter either because they’re actually logically consistent with the rest of the series but especially within the context of the new trilogy. 

You’re either willingly not paying attention to what the actual movies are telling you, or you’re too cynical to enjoy what shouldn’t be a problem to begin with. 

Imagination, these salty fans lack. Sad it is. 

Would you rather have movies that provide you with enough context clues for you to be able to fill in unimportant blank spots yourself, or films that hold your hand and show you every plodding detail?",StarWars,1572633129,TheDeug,324,63,True,2019-11-01
kotor trilogy center around bastila instead player character,"""Is this the most interesting time in your character's life? And if it's not why aren't you telling us that story?"" 

I wish I could remember who said this but it got me thinking about the possibility of a Kotor trilogy that follows the storyline of the original game but doesn't have Revan as the central character. Instead, you make Bastila the central Character and we let the audience in on the twist from the start and let it be something of a defining point of drama and behind the scenes tension between Bastila and the other characters. 

There would have to be changes to the story that would come through this type of adaptation. For instance, Taris would have to be changed rather substantially as she's captured and caged for 2/3 of the planet's story in the original. Perhaps in a movie with her as the title character, it's Revan who goes missing, and the tension between her and Carth rests in large part because she places what he see's as inordinate importance to finding a single soldier on the planet. 

**Movie 1**

Her ark in that first movie set on Taris would be about her pride being put in check by Carth and Mission, realizing that she's gifted but still needs others who know things that she doesn't. While she's learning this lesson she makes a mistake that she was warned about and could haunt the galaxy. In her arrogance, she opens Revan up to the force and starts to teach him to feel it. This is something the council would have warned her against before he was assigned to the Endar Spire. 

**Movie 2**

The second movie would be about finding the other star map, the one not on Dantooine which she and Revan would find early on in the movie. This movie would have Bastila's beliefs challenged and her faith tested. She is and has been lying and we get to raise questions about morality in the sense of ""Is doing the wrong thing for the right reasons okay?"" and ""Is it actually good to do the right thing for the wrong reasons."" We'd see Bastila struggle with her beliefs because this movie is set on Dantooine and Korriban. 

The central relationship in this movie is her and Revan (Even a will they won't they romantic relationship), we can see that she's got a lot of bluster and it's mostly a front for insecurity in her own beliefs. The Sith wouldn't be shown entirely as monsters as Bastila and Revan get to know Uthura Ban, their current teacher and a former slave who sought power in order to free her family, but instead fell into darkness. They raise points about the morality of the force while they train that Bastila doesn't have an answer for. We get a sense that Revan is more malleable in his beliefs and he looks to Bastila for guidance. She has to wrestle with what she'd done to him and that maybe they were wrong. 

The movie would end aboard the Leviathon. When the reveal comes Bastila loses everyone. Carth and Revan turn on her and Revan is out for blood against Malak and the Jedi Council. Instead of Bastila giving herself up to stop Malak we see Revan Trying to kill him, Revans memories having returned when Malak opens his eyes. We see an anger and a fire in Revan that we hadn't seen to that point. The doors close and Carth convinces Bastila that they have to go. They escape the Leviathon and we end the movie. 

**Movie 3**

Here we'd spend our time aboard the Rakata world, trying to get word to the republic after lowering the gravitational field around the station. The Arc for Bastila in this movie would be about achieving personal redemption after having lied and failed to save Revan. We're not given answers as to the fate of Malak aboard the Leviathon at the end of the last movie. It's assumed by the crew of the Ebon Hawk that Revan is dead and it's not sad for everyone. Bastila has to mend bridges that were burned at the end of the last movie with the revelation. We can see the sentiment is the others is that Revan was proof that the Jedi were all talk. She was proof of it because she lied to everyone and kept Revan right under their noses. Carth especially distances himself and retreats into a soldier shell. Bastila in this movie has to learn to lead by example. 

Once they get off of Rakata prime they hail the republic fleet and the final battle begins. The Sith are ready for it and the fighting is fierce. Once aboard the Star Forge Bastila attempts to use her battle meditation but we see that it doesn't have the effect they needed. The Sith are too strong and the movement of their fleet is too coordinated. The only choice is to find Malak and stop him. 

They all fight their way through the station and while aboard they become separated from each other through necessity. Bastila finds her way to the bridge to engage in the final confrontation with Malak... When the doors open she sees something that she wasn't expecting. Malak is at Revan's side. Master and Apprentice. It's a tense relationship, to say the least as Malak is like a muzzled dog in many respects. 

The fighting starts and at first, it's 2v1 with both of them fighting her. Think Darth Maul Dual but she double-bladed Jedi is losing. Then in a mirror to when Revan was captured by Malak turns and tries to kill his master. Allegiances form suddenly and Revan and Bastila fight to kill Malak. He dies by Revan's hand this time. At this moment Bastila has a chance to kill Revan but doesn't. She can't bring herself to do it and he taunts her like he wants her to kill him. She can't and instead, she apologizes. She's sorry for the lies and taking his identity. She puts down the lightsaber and gives him a choice, asking him to stop this. She asks him to remember who he was before the Dark Lord.  We see Revan take off his mask and we see the complex mix of emotions on his face says it all. 

He looks at his mask and then out at the fleet. She tells him that she loves him, that she doesn't believe that love is wrong. We see where she doesn't believe in everything that they teach or agrees with all of their choices they make. Revan looks at the fleet one more time, and turns to her, dropping his mask. We see her hand and she doesn't drop the lightsaber, the choice tears her apart but she can't bring herself to give it up. He understands and starts to walk away. He picks up his lightsaber and leaves, telling her than something is coming. He tells her that he's going to stop it and buy them time. Bastila is left on the bridge as Revan leaves the station in the Ebon Hawk with T3. She uses her battle meditation again and the tide turns. The Republic is victorious, the Star Forge is destroyed, Revan has gone to the unknown regions and we're given a hint that she is with child.

End of Trilogy. 

**Thoughts in Retrospect**

Originally I didn't mean for this to become an outline but I got carried away, it's why the first movie isn't detailed and the third where her trilogy arc concludes is detailed. 

I've never been comfortable with the idea that Revan would be okay with the Jedi taking away his memory. It always seemed far worse to me than just killing a prisoner. Taking away their free will is among the worst things I've seen the Jedi do in any star wars story I'm familiar with. So it never sat well with me that Revan would just go back to that order instead of doing what he always did, forge his own path. 

Ultimately through writing the story, I might find that it makes sense for Bastila to walk away from the order too. This is the choice in this outline that gave me the most pause. Because for her the Jedi are more than a group. 

The choice to keep Malak alive for the final fight is also one that I was on the fence about. It does make more sense that Revan would kill him but the sake of dramatic mirroring of the first confrontation she had with Revan I decided the needs of the story would come above the needs of the character at that moment. Because Revan as a tactician might decide not to kill him. 

I'd also like to make Revan a mirror for Bastila while on Korriban. He is in a way her temptation and her warning. She sees that he isn't fanatic about the Jedi but seems to be a good person. She also sees how easy it is to give in to darker urges through him. He also shows her that the Jedi aren't right about everything and that any dogmatic singular vision of the world is broken. 

The last thing I'll touch on is that to my mind Bastila is a very interesting character and her two key flaws are Arrogance and Insecurity. She is incredibly gifted but she's also very young and doesn't know how to handle having so much on her. She's not sure of herself and covers it up with bravado and bluster. Even though pride is the central flaw that she has to overcome in the first movie, it's a struggle across the trilogy and can only be overcome at the end of the trilogy. 

I'd love to hear any thoughts and opinions that you might have. I love writing this type of story outline and love discussing the story and how to tell good stories. Adaptation is especially fun in my opinion.",StarWars,1572634246,CatySecuirty,2,0,True,2019-11-01

revisiting art tfa tros trailer leaks spoilers theories,"I already shared this on Speculation but I thought I'd share it here too.

I know many of you have seen this before but I thought it might be cool to have a bit of a refresher on some things in the Art of TFA book. I looked through it recently and I realized that some of this stuff will be (or may be) used in TROS. 

If we’re to believe some rumblings about all the behind the scenes stuff, JJ may have had a different plan for TFA. I do believe he was asked to play it more on the safer side and do a softer (instead of riskier) reboot of sorts. I wasn’t sure how much of that was to believe but revisiting this book really made me somewhat convinced that there’s at least some truth to it. 

I don’t think he’ll retcon anything from the previous two films per se (and ignoring a plot line isn't a retcon after all), but after the final trailer and then me revisiting this book, I’m starting to wonder if he’ll actually get to tell a story that’s closer to what he originally intended even if it’s too late in some people’s eyes. 

Some of these have been brought up by Nerdist and other publications but I couldn’t find any posts or articles on the rest. I’ll share some photos here. I have a 9 month old so I couldn’t really take good photos this late at night. If you have better copies, by all means share them. Some of them wouldn’t be relevant to the plot itself but I think they may have inspired TROS visually in some way. 

* [“Junk Castle Landscape”](https://i.imgur.com/HTfurtw.jpg) - again, just visually, this reminds me of the ‘space horse’ scene in the trailer. I was curious how big a Resurgent Class Star Destroyer would be. It’s approximately 1.8 miles long and almost 1700 feet in height. In non-Freedom units, that’s half a kilometer only 300m shy of Burj Kalifa. Ever been on top of a super tall building? I have. It can get whack, especially in my area where fog and clouds can go low and you don’t see much below you. It’s almost impossible to even imagine this Star Destroyer because the scope is insane. So showing it pretty close (relatively speaking) to our characters makes it look like they’re high up in the sky. I don’t actually think they're in the sky at all but someone correct me if I missed something. I watched the trailer only a handful of times and I've been a tired mess lately. 

* [Anakin](https://i.imgur.com/KXd2BlC.jpg) - we’ve shared that photo a bunch here and I somehow recalled only this. But there’s Vader mentions throughout the book that go beyond just name dropping. I forgot that they even [included a photo of Hayden](https://i.imgur.com/Clos1fF.jpg) in there. Also, there’s another photo of [Luke holding the mask](https://i.imgur.com/tZFhiTq.jpg) that makes me wonder if he will appear to Luke. We’ve had nonstop debates over whether he’d appear to Kylo or Rey. Though Luke is a force ghost now and it’s not easy to imagine two force ghosts just chilling and having a heart to heart, I still feel like there’s more to tell there and I can't quite put my finger on what exactly. 

* This *may* have been mentioned before. Could [this be the place](https://i.imgur.com/3uOqX2k.jpg) where the Oracle is from?

* [This one was shared just about everywhere](https://i.imgur.com/iQ6l3qt.jpg) but I’m only posting it to reiterate that I think that JJ seriously had some of this shit planned all along and LFL came in the way. Though it’s under water, it’s still a visual revisit and the remains of the Death Star in the movie appear to be half under water anyway, just apparently not the Emperor room. 

* [This is far fetched](https://i.imgur.com/14SN3MC.jpg) but the general topography kind of matches?

feeling finn character two movies,"I will preface this post by saying that I don't dislike the Sequel trilogy. Overall I think it's fine. TFA was enjoyable. TLJ had more stuff I didn't enjoy but overall I still liked it because I thought it was trying to do some more interesting stuff with Star Wars (although stumbled a bit in the execution, and also the fact that it was trying to build off of TFA).

The thing I realized, though, is that these movies don't excite me or thrill me. They don't inspire strong emotions in me. When I compare to the OT, I was much more invested in what was happening there than I am to the events in the ST. And I think part of that is because I don't feel as attached to the characters. A lot has been written on Rey and Kylo etc. but for this post I want to focus on Finn, our once-stormtrooper-turned-rebel.

I am going to copy and paste a comment I made in another thread here:

&gt;My biggest disappointment is probably with the character of Finn. He has the most interesting backstory of the new characters. A stormtrooper who breaks free of brainwashing and fights against his former leaders? Really cool concept and there’s so much to explore there. Are other stormtroopers capable of the same depth of emotion? Does Finn carry guilt over his previous actions? Do people fighting against the First Order hate him for who he was? Why have we only seen Finn break free, did the force call to him? Etc.

&gt;There is so much to explore here, so many interesting concepts to mine for story/character development that I feel have barely been touched. I feel like Finn is more of a background character when he should honestly be a protagonist with the same level of importance as Rey. And they need to explore these questions more. They still could, but 2 movies in I don’t have faith that they will do any of this with enough depth, especially when Rey and Kylo seem to be the main focus of the next film.

What do you guys think? I genuinely believe Finn should have been the heart of this new trilogy. Maybe that was the intention, but it does not come off that way. More often than not I find that Finn is relegated to a character who is mainly there for comedic relief. He drinks water next to an animal, he asks Rey if she has a boyfriend, he gets overenthusiastic when confronting Phasma, he leaks fluids everywhere from his suit, etc. I don't think Finn needs to be force-sensitive or a jedi like some have suggested, but I want him to have more to do in these movies. I want more moments for him like standing off in the forest against Kylo or his final run towards the cannon on Crait. His character seems like it could be one of the most complex Star Wars characters we've seen yet but it feels like his potential has been wasted for these first two movies. Maybe TROS could surprise me but I have a hard time seeing that based on how much ground they need to cover with Rey, Kylo, and Palpatine.

Also, it's a bit weird to me that they introduce Finn as this previous stormtrooper who was literally kidnapped from his family and brainwashed, but then every other scene they're shooting stormtroopers left and right. I understand you need bad guys to shoot, henchmen, etc. But maybe have the heroes question that a bit? Maybe show Finn having a visceral reaction to gunning down his former brothers-and-sisters in arms?

I don't want to come off too ranty in this post, I just wanted to express something that has been bothering me for a while in the sequel trilogy. I hope we can have a genuine discussion about this and not dismiss any opinions as invalid. I really want to hear what everyone else has to say about this.",StarWars,1572640969,decross20,12,13,True,2019-11-01
darth vader vs kylo rey,"Who do you feel would come out on top. Kylo and Rey are supposed to be stronger than any other Jedi or Sith. But I still think Vader could easily take both of them. I really think depending on his goals he would kill them both fairly quickly. My reasoning for this is that Vader lives during a time of constant war where he was constantly tested by the best Sith and later Jedi. Neither Rey or Kylo have ever fought any true Jedi or Sith besides each other in Fair 1v1 combat. This would lead me to believe Vader would cut through them both with ease.

anakin strong weak minded,"After the argument that Anakin was the better Jedi I wanted to weigh in on how easy Anakin was swayed to the Dark Side by Palpatine.  I do want to note the naivety of the Jedi to see what was happening around them and being a puppet to a Sith Lord doesn't go down well especially from Anakins viewpoint. However,  Palpatine views and opinions had an affect with Anakin from early on in the saga especially regarding Padme which ironically Anakin ended up causing her premature death. 

So a Better Jedi for me would be for one to be in sync with his mind, feelings and power which Anakin did some of the time but not enough.  Like a Better Jedi would not murder Younglings even if he saw the Jedi as the Enemy as they could have been retrained with being Force Users. And although he did eventually find his way back to the light Anakin as ""Vadar"" did murder alot of Jedi including Children so in my opinion he isn't a Better Jedi than Rey or Luke. The better Jedi was Mace Windu who would have killed the Sith Threat forever if not for Anakin weak Minded last minute turn to Palpatines pleas. 

If Windu had successful killed Palpatine then order 66 would never had been given, the Jedi would have brought evidence to the Senate on why the Supreme Chancellor was killed by them. And maybe just maybe Padme would have survived if Anakin had gone to Yoda or even Obi Wan about the fact he was going to become a father. Most of the top Jedi knew the Jedi needed to be reformed and after a Sith Lord had put these plans in motion without even the Jedi knowing it was under their nose. I am sure if Windu had killed Palpatine then the Jedi would have gone under massive change to make sure they would never go so close to destruction again.

spoilers main selling point mandalorian,"Im not looking too much to this show even though im familar with many of the cast. What is sad though is this is what should have been the sequel to return of the jedi, not this current trilogy which is just the same jedi-sith story all over again. The mandalorian seems more fresh and a bit original. The problem is again the obvious prequel thing but im not getting into that. But a main selling point apparently is exploring the difference between good and evil like we havent seen this already. I mean without going on a big rant, we dont need that, i think people in general know the difference, we dont need being told like a school lesson. If they want to make a villian like someone who is stealing food to support them or their families or someone who has a sick twisted habit but is fighting to get rid of it, that is fine too but these arent original concepts, there is no reason to advertise them as such either. Which shows they dont have much else to sell to the audience in order to buy disney plus. 

&amp;#x200B;

Cause I dont care to see how the first order came to be, I just dont care. Maybe if it confirms the existence of certain characters that havent been seen in this new trilogy, that could be okay cause it might hint at their return in rise of skywalker or another sequel(which are reportedly being made by rian johnson and kevin feige). Sadly though no use in asking for a boba fett return cause I read he isnt in this show.

comparing box office numbers,"I did this for a comment on an r/starwarsmemes post but I thought it was interesting so I'll post it here. 

I wanted to see how the Lucas Star Wars box office numbers compared to Disneys. But to compare apples to apples I am only comparing the initial theatrical runs domestically plus international box office since the OT and TPM numbers are skewed by being release 2 or 3 times. I couldn't find break downs if the international numbers so the OT gets a bump by international rereleases. Then I adjusted all the totals to 2019 dollars.

The results are interesting. Obviously IV was the biggest box office. It was a monster at $2.29 billion. But VII wasn't far behind with $2.22 billion. The average  Lucas Star Wars films averaged $1.24 billion ($1.43 if we drop the worst). Disney average $1.28 billion. But Solo is a bit of an outlier. So if we looked at the averages of three highest Lucas gets $1.67 billion compared to $1.58 billion for Disney. 

So, Lucas has the highest grossing and the average of his 3 best is higher than Disney's 3 best but they're both close. On average Disney has a slight edge.",StarWars,1572654552,bumpjon,4,0,True,2019-11-01

I'm working on an oc that's a an echani mercenary that's operating in the pre clones wars and and clone wars era who's later hired out by the separatists. He has an astromech droid and has a Mando partner I'm also using the EU Canon for this because I have waaaay more content to work with compared to Disney Canon.

What would be good starship options for him and I mean both starfighter and cap ship capacity?

Like someone said I could go with them doing a hush hush job for a big wig at Republic Sienar Systems and receive one of the limited production star couriers, then they have ~10 years before the Clone Wars start up for them to have it modified for real combat. I feel like there are more options out there and I'm open to about anything including capital ships ((corvette and up)) and freighters that can be modified for combat. Also according to one of the star wars rpg guide ancient starships are apparently on the table as well granted you can fix or make them relevant again.

anyone else become huge fan introduced star wars force awakens,"I often find myself in between a bunch of groups when it comes to Star Wars fandom. I didn’t “grow up” with any era of Star Wars, the first one I watched was The Force Awakens when I was in college. I fell in love with Rey, Finn, Poe, Han, Chewie, Maz, Leia, and honestly even in Kylo.

I *had* to go back and watch everything I could. My friends sat me down and we saw 4,5,1,2,3,6 and then we rewatched TFA. At that point, I was in love with this universe. I started reading every canon book and comic out there, and watched through all of The Clone Wars and everything out there for Rebels.

I’m so happy to have been introduced through TFA because it was really accessible for me at that point in my life. And honestly, growing up, Star Wars wasn’t really something I was exposed to, and I think that’s pretty common in black communities. I more grew up on Spider Man, Batman, and anime. 

And now, I love everything Star Wars. I’ve gone through and consumed a lot of Legends, even though alot of it isn’t for me. I’ve played the video games, and am taking a day off for Jedi: Fallen Order so I can play uninterrupted all weekend long. Already got tickets to see Rise of Skywalker at back to back showings.

The only thing that bugs me is that it seems like there are so few people like me who were introduced by TFA and have become super fans. I think alot of kids who saw TFA as their first SW movie are going to grow up into super fans (especially of the sequels similar to how my generation is with the prequels), but I have never talked to anyone here that is in a similar situation as me.

story something happened recently friend,"So the story im about to tell is going to sound like complete and utter BS but I swear on my life it happened. So its my friends birthday and I decided to get him a darth vader lightsaber I found at a local pawn shop. Well the day before his birthday party I decided to give it to him early so we went and picked it up. I had put it on layaway a few days prior. Well after we went shopping for the party the next day,  we decided to take a quick detour by my house and pick up my blue Anakin Skywalker lightsaber, cause we wanted to mess around with them. So on our way back to his place we decided to take a route through a large empty parking lot not too far from our destination. So seeing that it was a nice open area where we could easily swing our sabers around and not worry about bystanders getting in the way or banging our blades on anything around us. So we stay there for a while and decide to play around with our recently acquired products. Skipping ahead about 5 minutes or so later I notice a car pull and park. This empty lot is at the end of a dead end road btw. And After a few seconds we hear some kids voices coming from the car chanting ""fight! Fight!fight!fight!"" And that's when we look at each other and lock eyes. The duel has begun. I swing high and my friend swings just in time to counter. He blocks my attack. I swing low and then high and then low again each time he deflects my attacks. Then our blades meet and lock together and we both attempt to hold each other off. Then I suddenly stumble back and he swings and I counter just in time and swiftly strike back this time he stumbles back and his stance slips and I find an opening. I go in for the killing blow and swing at his torso. Going with our little larping role play fight he collapses to the floor and the kids cheer. One of them then yells ""finish him!!!""  And I advance toward him on the ground and swing my blade in a circular motion and stab down, making it appear as though I stabbed him and finished him off. 
The kids are now cheering and applauding for us so I wave to them and bow. And the car drives off.

anikin becoming one force,"So you all know how when Obi and Yoda pass on to the force their bodies vanished with them, but how Qui-Gon's didn't because his training wasn't complete and Anikin's didn't because his joining with the force was aided by the others. 

After seeing what existence was like from a Force Ghost's perspective in 'From A Certain Point of View', I like the idea that Anakin experiences a kind of purgatory.

Like, he enters the netherworld of the force looking how he did as a kid and is guided by Qui-Gon, then as Hayden Christensen and is guided by Yoda, and finally as the man he should have been being guided by Obi Wan. Perhaps he duels Vader and triumphs by overcoming his guilt, and maybe has to confront the tormented spirits of all those he hurt as Vader. Imagine him being overwhelmed by literally billions of phantoms, with cameos of characters from the comics and movies. It's be cool to see characters obscure and well known that were effected by Vader, to visually convey all those that he hurt in a visceral way. The Storm Trooper who's head he twisted around, The Inquisitors he killed, Darth Maul, Minister Tua, Biggs Darklighter, Bail Organa, Rebellion Solders, Dooku, Shaak Ti, the list goes on. 

Maybe seeing him regress further and further inwards until its Young Anikin being confronted by the Tuskan and Jedi Younglings, until he has to cower inside Vader's armor. Maybe being haunted by visions of Kylo's future and Luke and Leia's failure to prevent a new evil from rising. 

Weird flex, but what if it's like the very end of Hellsing: Abridged where Alucard has to work through the problems of all the souls he'd consumed. I mean not that weird since Palpatines Redemption in the Robot Chicken Star Wars Special is what got me thinking about this. That and the scene from Doctor Strange where he sees the multiverse. And I guess The Good Place... Darth Vader in the Good Place... Anywho i'm getting off topic. The way he redeems himself shouldn't be quick or easy like the dark side is. Like, if he wants to become one with the force his consciousness would experience millions of years of of the lives of those he hurt, until the last person he has to face is himself.

And at the end when he somehow finds peace, he joins The Force and is among the spirits of Padme and Shmi, able to be with the ones he loves, the only thing he ever wanted.

wanna talk revenge sith second,"I don't feel that this movie gets the credit that it deserves. The special effects in nearly every scene are phenomenal. There's a few points where the CGI was bad, but for the time that it was made, most of it works very well and even holds up better than a lot of CGI in movies today with General Grievous being the best example. Go back and look at how incredibly realistic he looks compared to even what Marvel does today. It constantly amazes me. General Grievous is a character that has always been a favorite of mine because he just looks so cool. He has an amazing design.

Every fight is this movie is beautifully choreographed. They are fast-paced and complicated and the sound design in each fight makes it all feel more raw.

It has a that dialogue issue that all the prequals share and has some... not so great acting at times, but, for me, there are few movies more quotable than this one. I feel I know every line and I constantly find myself quoting it. Also, it is a treasure trove of memes.

I honestly can't praise the performances of Ian McDiarmid and Ewan McGregor enough. I'm a sucker for over-acting, and McDiarmid just embodies that in this movie. He throws himself into his role like no other could. He has the biggest stand-out performance for me and he delivers every line and mannerism perfectly. Honestly, even if I don't like Rise of Skywalker, I expect nothing less than an amazing performance from McDiamid. His hugely complicated plan goes off without a hitch, (at least until his newest weapon gets cut down and burned because he didn't have the high ground). He literally manufactured both a massive, galaxy-wide war and the armies that fought in it, destroyed the Jedi Order in one foul swipe, took complete control of both the Senate and the courts, gained a new, much more powerful, loyal apprentice, and established an Empire large enough to keep nearly the whole Galaxy in line. Chancellor Sheev ""the Senate"" Palpatine, you mad dog! He, like Obi Wan, got so much cooler from the events in the prequals. 

McGregor brought a perfect amount of wisdom and cleverness to the character that really befits Alec Guinness's original portrayal of him. Obi Wan becomes the most sympathetic character in this movie for me. As many have pointed out, Star Wars is a tale of failed father figures. Obi Wan failed horribly as Anakin's teacher. That's tough to hear, as one wouldn't have even noticed anything he did wrong without looking at what could have happened. Qui Gon constantly questioned the wisdom of the Jedi Counsel and more or less did his own thing. If Qui Gon were Anakin's teacher, as was the plan, he would have been much less strict than Obi Wan. Qui Gon wouldn't have been so scared to teach Anakin about the dark side and Anakin wouldn't have been as curious about Palpatine's proposition had he known the dangers of the Sith's path and how it corrupts those who follow it. Anakin may have felt comfortable enough to tell Qui Gon about his relationship with Padme and I doubt he would react negatively. Obi Wan was too strict and controlling and offered little emotional support as the council had decided that all emotions were a path to the dark side. Anakin couldn't trust Obi Wan with the knowledge of his relationship and felt the need to hide it. When he started having dreams about Padme's death, (and I have a theory that Palpatine may having been feeding him these dreams to soften him up for his manipulation, but that's another matter) of course he'd look for solutions anywhere but the Jedi and Obi Wan. Obi Wan did what he thought was the right thing to do, but found out the hard way that everything he did had disastrous outcomes. In all his wisdom, he never could have known that his actions would push Anakin towards the dark side. That's why in their final confrontation in the movie when Obi Wan says to Anakin, ""I have failed you, Anakin.... I have failed you"", I feel that he's finally realizing all the things he did wrong. For all the tragedy shared in this movie, Obi Wan likely feels, by far, the most guilt. This all makes the Old Ben Kenobi we see in a New Hope much more compelling. He's an old war veteran who's failures led to the subjugation of the Galaxy. He's retreated to a life of isolation in order to protect the child he believes is the real chosen one. When he feels he's ready, he decided to train him so that he could defeat Vader and the Emperor. This makes Luke's biggest triumph double as Obi Wan's redemption.

This isn't just Obi Wan's failure, however. Another of the many failures that led to the fall of the Jedi, was the Jedi themselves. When you have an organization where members can't question the leadership, you're just going to encourage more questions. When the counsel made a decision, no Jedi could defy it. Strictness inspires rebellion. The Jedi were overbearing and restrictive, trying to even keep their members from even thinking in a way they considered inappropriate. The counsel feared losing control over their fellow Jedi so much that they forbade their knights from even teaching their padowans about the dark side. Palpatine had clouded their minds so thoroughly that they couldn't detect one of the most powerful beings (Palpatine) in the Galaxy when he was right under their noses. They became suspicious of everyone. They became paranoid that they would lose the power they had in the Senate, Mace Windu most of all. When Anakin tried to stop Windu from killing Palpatine, Windu said the same thing Palpatine said to Anakin after killing Count Dooku- ""he's too dangerous to be kept alive!"" In that moment, Anakin realized there was no difference between the Jedi and the Sith and only the Sith were offering him a solution to his biggest fear.

I can't decide what my favorite Star Wars movie is. It's either Revenge of the Sith or Empire Strikes Back. What I do know is they are both fantastic movies in my eyes. Many people dislike the prequals, but as someone who grew up with them, those 6 movies ARE Star Wars for me.",StarWars,1572705807,FuckTumblrMan,52,30,True,2019-11-02

rise skywalker theories skywalkers vs emperor,"Here's a couple of theories I've been thinking about that would link the mystery of Ray's power and Snoke's power while both of them not being originally trained as Jedis or Siths.

- Since Rey is regarded as a nobody in the Last Jedi, but a force-sensitive person, her first encounter with Anakin's lightsaber gave her his connection with the force. After all, it was said that the lightsaber was calling out to her, that it had chosen her. It could be Anakin's spirit that had chosen her and then indirectly guided her through the force. Also, after she was captured, she was able to successfully counter Kylo's interrogation and know his biggest secret of being afraid that he would not be as powerful as Darth Vader (something Anakin would know after Kylo had tried several times to reach out to Darth Vader's spirit?)

- Since the Emperor has returned, it could be said that the Emperor had used his connection with the Dark side to power Snoke as a distraction for the Resistance so he could restore his own full strength. After all, Snoke was not a Sith, nor ever heard of, yet his power came from the dark side. This is not far off, as Snoke used his power to draw a connection in the force with Kylo and Ren as he had mentioned before his death.

- The final battle in Rise of Skywalker might just be the Anakin and Luke as force ghosts with Kylo Ren joining in at the last moment defeating the Emperor. We have seen force ghosts such as Yoda, being able to use the force from their dimension to affect the physical world (Yoda using lighting on the sacred texts).

The last theory would align with the title of Rise of Skywalker, it's not one skywalker that rises, but all of them.",StarWars,1572721488,unknown13371,0,1,True,2019-11-02

husband wrote play class following stormtrooper tk created whole storyline think amazing scared share enjoy,"Behind the Helmet

“You grew up wanting so bad to be Luke Skywalker, but you realize that you were basically a Stormtrooper, a faceless, nameless rifleman, carrying a spear for empire, and you start to accept the startlingly obvious truth that these are people like you.”

- Daniel Crimmins from U.S. Army 3rd Infantry Division

Author’s note: 

Behind the Helmet was inspired by this quote by Daniel Crimmins, who is in the U.S. Army and is a Iraq War veteran. This quote was about how they had their 9/11 patriotism crushed &amp; replaced with something that made them feel disgusting and hate themselves. So I started thinking: What about the Stormtrooper that started out wanting to do good, and found out that they were a part of something horrible? No one really ever focuses on the nameless Stormtroopers who die by the “good guys”. I found my focus drawn to one that appears in Star Wars: Episode IV, whose designation is TK-421, and is one of the only ones you hear in the movie. The only information about him is that he wasn’t at his post in the movie. I just wanted to give him a story, and also our own country’s people who serve, so that they aren’t just a number or a helmet. That they have their own dreams and ambitions and lives.

ACT ONE
Scene One

Lights come on to a Clone Stormtrooper with the designation TK-421 standing center stage. He addresses the audience directly.

TK-421: I was born a clone, whose purpose was to fight, to be a soldier. All I’ve ever wanted was to be the best at what I did. To be the perfect soldier who makes a difference for the better. That’s how most soldiers start out, until they find out that they are just pawns in an evil man’s game of chess and that there is no such thing as killing for good. This is where I started in my mission to be the perfect soldier, right when I graduated from training and was about to go out into the real world. Oh, how young and naïve I was to think that I could make a difference by going to war.
  
Lights go dark.

Lights turn on to an open room with rows of seats that are filled with Clone troopers whose attention is on a podium in the front of the room. The room is filled with nervous chatter from all the newly graduated recruits. Among them is a young TK-421, at the age of twenty, who talks to his friends sitting near him.

TK-421: I can’t believe it’s finally here, after all these years, we’re finally done with training.

TK-422: Yeah, and you still can’t hit a target with your blaster.

TK-421: Well at least I know how to turn on my headset transmitter before a drill so I don’t end up by myself hiding in a bathroom stall.

TK-422: Hey, I told you, my transmitter was broken… and I was holding it all day.

(The small group of friends chuckle as the two poke fun at each other.)

An officer of the rank of Captain walks in to the room, to where all the Clone troopers come to attention. The officer walks to the podium and addresses the room. 

Captain: Take your seats. I know this is a proud and exciting day for you all, but I want you all to remember that you are now going out into real battle zones and situations with real enemies that can, and will, kill you. This is where all your years of training will aid you and keep you alive if you keep it as instinct for you when you don’t know what to do. Now you all should be receiving your orders on where you will be stationed for your first command on your personal communicators momentarily. After you receive them, they will include information on what shuttles you are to board to the system you are stationed at. You will go straight there from here and all of your belongings will already be on the shuttle waiting for you. Now I wish you all luck with wherever you get stationed and with what you end up doing in your military careers and hope to see you all in the Fleet someday. Congratulations.

The room comes to attention as the Captain walks out of the room. Within seconds, the graduates’ personal communicators start beeping to inform them of their new orders. Everyone starts chatting and asking questions about each other’s orders and where they got stationed.

(TK-421 looks over at TK-422 as his personal communicator beeps.)

TK-421: So what did you get?

TK-422: Someone better be playing a joke on me, I’m not going to a planet where I have to talk to walking carpets.

TK-421: Does that mean Kashyyk or Endor?

TK-422: Kashyyk, if it was Endor, I would’ve said walking floor mats.

(TK-421 chuckles just as his personal communicator beeps.)

TK-422: I hope you got stuck with Hoth, so you have to freeze your butt off for 5 years.

TK-421: No, even worse, this armor is going to be a sweat suit with how humid it’s going to be.

TK-422: Ah, good ole’ Felucia. Not to mention the giant bugs and plants you have to deal with. That’s not that bad though.

(They start to argue about whose orders are worse when another graduate, who is wearing the designation TK-435, walks over to them.)

TK-435: So where did you two butt knuckles get stationed?

TK-422: What’s it to you 435? Need to know where to send us flowers?

(TK-421 chuckles at this and draws a glare from TK-435.)

TK-435: No, I just need to know where to send some extra blasters so that they can use them to finally shut you two up.

TK-422: Oh, is that because you can’t do it yourself?

TK-435: Shut up, just because you two got the top scores of the class doesn’t mean I can’t shoot you like anything else.

TK-421: Maybe, but that would mean that you’d have to figure out how to use the blaster first.

(TK-421 and TK-422 burst into laughter as TK-435 storms off.)

TK-422: I’m going to miss messing with 435.

TK-421: Yeah, same here. I think I’ll mainly miss just having you here to be my partner in crime though.

TK-422: Hey, it doesn’t mean we can’t still be stationed together later, or visit each other when we have leave.

TK-421: I know, it’s just that things are going to change so much after today, and I’m not sure that I want them to.

TK-422: Don’t worry, you’re going to do great in whatever comes, you always do. Just like how you got top of the class all these years. I’m sure you’ll probably tame all the giant dragonflies by the time you’re done there or something crazy like that.

TK-421: And I’m sure you’ll still have at least one of your arms left when you leave Kashyyk.

(They both chuckle a bit. Then an announcement goes out over the speakers that it’s now time to board the shuttles to their assigned systems.)

TK-422: Well I guess this is it.

TK-421: Yup, I guess so.

TK-422: Don’t be a stranger now and make sure to keep in contact.

TK-421: Oh please, I don’t think I’m the one we have to worry about with that here.

TK-422: That’s true, you are always on top of things like that. Well I guess I’ll see you around then.

TK-421: Yeah, see you. And good luck out there.
They both walk away from each other and head towards opposite doors. Just as they’re about to exit the room, they turn and look at each other and give a little salute, then walk out.

The lights go dark and you hear TK-421’s voice.

TK-421: Little did I know that that would be the last time I see or hear from him for 15 years.

Scene Two

The stage is dark and you hear TK-421’s voice.

TK-421: When you’re in training and you have to memorize all these orders, just in case you have to execute them for crazy situations; And you memorize one that states: Kill all Jedi, you don’t actually think you’re going to have to do it. Why would you kill the peace keepers of the galaxy? But, we aren’t allowed to question what we do, we just do it.

Lights come up to what appears as being outside in a world that has giant plants and forms a type of jungle. On the right side of the stage is a small group of Clone troopers, and a Jedi Twilek, whose name is Aayla Secura, appears to be scouting to the left. The Clone troopers, with TK-421 among them, are in a circle talking when the commander’s personal holocommunicator beeps and he sees it’s the supreme chancellor.

Commander: Quiet up lads, it’s the Chancellor.

(The group falls silent as the Commander answers.)

Chancellor: Commander, it’s time, execute Order 66.

Commander: Yes, my lord.

(The call then hangs up and the Commander looks at his troops.)

TK-421: He can’t be serious can he?

Commander: If there’s anything the chancellor is, it’s serious.

TK-421: But why? Why would we have to do this? We can’t.

Commander: It doesn’t matter, we have to. We follow orders, and don’t question them. It’s what we were born to do.

(The group moves off over to the Jedi while TK-421 stands there, appearing to be too stunned to move.)

Commander: Miss Secura, we picked up movement on our radars east of here.

Aayla: Very well, let us head that way then.

(The group walks offstage with TK-421 still standing there. Then the noise of blasters and a thud like a body dropping is heard and TK-421 falls to his knees.)

The lights go dark. You hear TK-421’s voice.

TK-421: What could they have done to deserve this?

Scene Three

The stage is dark and you hear TK-421’s voice.
TK-421: Three years it took before I finally felt human again after that day. I was reminded of who I was, by a girl I just happened to meet after I got stationed on Corruscant. The world that is one big city. A city of life. But even in a city of life, you can come very close to death.
The lights come on to a hospital room. Nurses wheel in a gurney with an unconscious  Stormtrooper on it and bring it to the middle of the room where they stop. A female doctor walks in to the room.

Doctor: What happened here?

Nurse: Blaster fire to abdomen.

Doctor: Some people just don’t know how to duck.

Nurse: Actually, they said that he jumped in front of it to save another soldier.

Doctor: Oh, now why would he do that? What’s his name?

Nurse: Doesn’t have one, he’s a clone. Guess they just call him TK-421.

(TK-421 starts to stir and groan on the gurney.)
Doctor: TK-421, can you hear me?

TK-421: What happened? What happened to him, is he okay?

Doctor: Is who okay?

TK-421: The new kid, I told him to get down but he was in shock and wouldn’t listen. I had no other choice.

Nurse: He’s fine, he’s one of the guys that brought you in.

Doctor: Why would you jump in front of him like that?

TK-421: Guess I just wanted to do something that I could finally be proud of.

Doctor: Well that was very brave of you, stupid, but brave. You saved his life.

(TK-421 turns his head and looks at the Doctor.)

TK-421: You are the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen.

(The Doctor turns to the nurse.)

Doctor: Did they say if he hit his head?

Nurse: No, I don’t think so.

TK-421: Are you an angel?

Doctor: Must be the blood loss.

TK-421: I must know your name.

Doctor: If it will make you be quiet, it’s Kahlan. 
Please save your energy now.

TK-421: Kahlan, that’s beautif—

(TK-421 passes out midsentence.)

Kahlan: Okay, we need to hurry up and operate before he loses anymore blood.

(They wheel the gurney out of the scene.)
Lights go dark.

Scene Four

The stage is dark and you hear TK-421’s voice.

TK-421: That day that I almost died, I was reminded of what it was like to help someone. When I woke up from the surgery, I still thought the doctor was an angel. Maybe a guardian angel. Someone who helped people for a living. I had to see more of her. So that’s what I did, almost every day during my recovery, I would go back and find her and wait for her to get off her shift. Then we would just hang out and talk. I would learn more about her and what drives her to do what she does. She made me feel alive and like who I was meant to be. I didn’t want to lose her when I healed and had to leave. So we did what any two people in love and scared of being apart do.

The lights come on to a small wedding chapel with TK-421 standing at the front next to a minister. He’s looking down the aisle as Kahlan walks up to the two.

Kahlan: Did you really have to wear your uniform?

TK-421: It’s a tradition when we get married.

Kahlan: But why does it have to be white?

TK-421: Sorry, we don’t get to choose it.

Kahlan: Well I’m going to have to talk to them about it.

TK-421: Good luck with that. In the meantime, you ready to get married?

Kahlan: Absolutely.

(Smiling, they turn to the minister as he goes through the ceremony and comes to the end.)

Minister: TK-421, do you take Kahlan to be your wedded wife, to live together in marriage?  Do you promise to love her, comfort her, honor and keep her for better or worse, for richer or poorer, in sickness and health, and forsaking all others, be faithful only to her, for as long as you both shall live?

TK-421: I do.

Minister: Kahlan, do you take TK-421 to be your wedded husband to live together in marriage?  Do you promise to love him, comfort him, honor and keep him for better or worse, for richer or poorer, in sickness and health and forsaking all others, be faithful only to him so long as you both shall live?

Kahlan: I do.

The lights go dark.

Scene Five

The stage is dark and you hear TK-421’s voice.

TK-421: I always thought that when my mandatory 10 years would come that I would get out and know what I’d want to do. When it came though, I thought I could still do good and help by being a soldier. Kahlan thought I should get out and find what to do on my own. I wish I would’ve listened to her.

The lights come on to a small, nicely furnished room with some high ranking officers sitting at a desk. TK-421 enters the room and comes to attention before the officers. A Captain walks out in front of TK-421.

Captain: You know, I couldn’t believe it when I heard that it was you. I remember you from your training days, one of the best I’ve ever had. Glad to see you want to continue doing great things for the Empire for another 10 years. You’re one hell of a soldier.

TK-421: Thank you, I’m honored to, sir.

Captain: Now then, let’s get on with it.

(The Captain and TK-421 go through the re-enlistment ceremony.)

The lights slowly fade until it’s black.

Scene Six

The stage is dark and you hear TK-421’s voice.

TK-421: When you marry a doctor, there’s this feeling that nothing will happen to them and that they’ll never get sick. Silly, I know.
The lights come on to a hospital room. Kahlan is laying in the bed hooked up to machines with TK-421 next to her. A doctor walks in to the room.

Doctor: I’m sorry, Kahlan.

Kahlan: Just tell me, I can handle it.

Doctor: It’s just like you said…

Kahlan: Lung cancer…

Doctor: Yes, I don’t know how we didn’t catch it sooner. It’s already grown past the first stages of containment. I’m afraid there’s nothing we can do to stop it.

TK-421: But how can this happen? How can it be lung cancer?

Kahlan: It must have been from when I went to Nal Hutta for that trip to help the locals with medical treatment.

Doctor: I also think that’s it. We don’t know what kind of chemicals and toxins those Hutts are pumping out of their factories. I’ve never seen it grow so fast.

TK-421: I told you I didn’t want you to go there, it was too dangerous. I shouldn’t have allowed it.
Kahlan: I would’ve gone anyways, and you know it. Those poor people needed help, who am I to deny them it?

TK-421: You can deny them when it causes your own death.

Kahlan: I can’t put my life above someone else’s. If I can help somebody and am able to then I will.

TK-421: I know, I just don’t want to lose you. Do you know how long she has doctor?

Doctor: I’m afraid that at this rate, she may only have a month or possibly two left. I’m so sorry Kahlan. We will do whatever we can to help you through it.

Kahlan: Thank you, doctor.

(The doctor leaves the room)

TK-421: I can’t let this happen. We can find something, we can fight it.

Kahlan: Honey, it’s okay. If it’s my time to go, then it’s my time. There is no fighting this one, I’m sorry.

TK-421: That’s the only thing i know to do.

Kahlan: I know, but all we can do now is spend what time we have left together. I will love you until I’m not able to anymore. And when I’m gone, my love will still be with you.

TK-421: But you’re all I have. I don’t know what I’m going to do, you’re what reminds me of my purpose. I’ll be lost without you. You’re my guardian angel.

Kahlan: No, you won’t. I will still be with you in your heart. And you’re still going to live on and do what you know is in your heart. You will make me proud with how you live your life. And I will be watching you, smiling.

TK-421: I will, after I retire, I will live how you lived. I will make a difference and I will help anyone who needs it. I will do this for you.

The lights go dark and you hear TK-421’s voice.

TK-421: She passed 5 weeks later, in her sleep while holding my hand. She left a note on the table that read “You don’t have to wait to start making a difference.”

Scene Seven

The stage is dark and you hear TK-421’s voice.

TK-421: After Kahlan passed, it’s like my mind was turned off and I was a robot. Just going through the motions. I always would just tell myself that I just needed to make it to retirement. Then I could be happy again and start doing good. I got a little surprise though when I got to my new and last duty station. The Death Star.

The lights come on to a docking bay hangar. A small shuttle is on the right. The door to the shuttle opens and out walks TK-421. As he reaches the bottom of the ramp, he hears someone call to him.

TK-422: 421! Is that really you?

TK-421: 422? What are you doing here?

TK-422: I just got here a couple days ago, can you believe the size of this station? It’s like a small moon!

TK-421: It is pretty incredible, just a shame its purpose is to destroy planets.

TK-422: Always so positive 421, just like I remember you! We have a lot of catching up to do.

TK-421: That we do. You’re the first person I’ve seen again since training.

TK-422: Speaking of that, you remember that empty-headed of a trooper TK-435?

TK-421: Of course.

TK-422: Well did you hear what happened to him?

TK-421: No, did he eat a whole bantha by himself or something?

TK-422: No, they executed him!

TK-421: What?!

TK-422: Yeah, when he was on Tattooine, I guess they were looking for these two droids that were involved with the rebellion somehow.

TK-421: Droids? Like battle droids?

TK-422: No, that’s the thing. It was just some protocol droid and a little astro droid. Apparently they were carrying information to the rebellion. Anyways, it turns out that he let those two droids, an old man, and some kid that was with them, get away and escape the planet!

TK-421: Why would he do that?

TK-422: He said that he doesn’t remember letting them go and claims that he was forced to. Ha! Like some old hermit on Tattooine is secretly going to be a Jedi who got away all these years. So, of course they didn’t believe him and Darth Vader himself executed him.

TK-421: Wow, I wasn’t fond of the guy, but I didn’t want him dead.

TK-422: Guess some people just can’t handle the stress of being a trooper and it messes with their head.

TK-421: Guess so.

TK-422: Anyways, I’ll show you where the barracks are at so you can put your stuff away, then we can head to the galley and catch up.

The two walk offstage as the lights fade to black. TK-421’s voice is heard.

TK-421: It took me a few years after Kahlan passed to finally start to be able to be happy about things, and 422 definitely sped that up and helped me through it. But I still always felt like a part of myself couldn’t truly be happy again until I could get out and do what I promised her.  

Scene Eight

The stage is dark and you hear TK-421’s voice.

TK-421: It’s a happy day when it’s your last day before retirement. Serving for 20 years gives you a nice little paycheck every month. And knowing that after that day, you can finally be free to do what you want and be your own person, well, it’s a great feeling. To finally be able to move onto something that would make Kahlan proud.

The lights come on to what looks like a galley. TK-421 and TK-422 are sitting at the table in the middle eating and conversing.

TK-422: So this is it, the last half of your last day. Don’t forget to enjoy this lovely looking sludge they call food here.

TK-421: Oh yes, I’m sure that’s what I’ll be missing most when I’m grilling my own bantha steaks.

(TK-422 laughs then groans.)

TK-422: Sounds nice man.

TK-421: Then why didn’t you get out as well?

TK-422: I thought I could, but… I don’t know anything else besides being a soldier, it’s what I am. I don’t know what I would do with myself. You don’t feel that way?

TK-421: No, I know now, I know what I’ve always really wanted this whole time but was too blind. Kahlan reminded me of who I was, of what I wanted to do with my life. I want to finally help others, not hurt or scare them. I want to make a difference, if not for myself, for Kahlan.

(An alarm sounds and a voice comes on the intercom.)

Intercom: Attention all available Troopers, we have intercepted an incoming vessel in our tractor beam. It is going to be docked in docking bay 327. We need to all available Troops to docking bay 327 for a vessel search and apprehension of the crew.

TK-422: Ooo sounds like some action.
TK-421: That I don’t need on my last day.

TK-422: Well we don’t have much of a choice. We have to go.

TK-421: Okay, okay. Let’s go then. Let me just finish the last sludge I’ll ever eat here.
They both walk out of the scene as the lights go dark.

The lights come on to a scene that looks to be a big hangar with the ship, the Millennium Falcon, on the right and Stormtroopers in a formation with an officer in front of them giving them orders on the left. TK-421 and TK-422 are seen walking up late to the group. The officer, a lieutenant, turns towards them and speaks.

Lieutenant: Well how nice of you two to join us. You know, just cause it’s your last day here doesn’t mean you can slack off, TK-421.

TK-422: Calm down son, he was just enjoying his last fine meal upon this lovely station.

Lieutenant: That’s Lieutenant to you, TK-422. I’d be sure to remember that if I were you, as you’re not the one that’s retiring tomorrow and can still be thrown in the brig.

TK-422: Why, I oughta call your mothe--

TK-421: Yes sir, Lieutenant. He’ll make sure to heed your advice and sorry for being late.

(The Lieutenant gives them a look, then faces the formation again.)

Lieutenant: Very well, just get into formation.

TK-421: Yes sir.

(The two move around towards the back of the formation and TK-422 whispers to TK-421.)

TK-422: Why’d you cut me off for? I was about to put him in his place.

TK-421: Which would have embarrassed him and caused him to do something rash and punish both of us. It’s my last day here, I’d really not like to spend it cleaning toilets.

TK-422: Very well, I just wanted to have some fun. I’m going to miss messing with the young guns with you. Just like old times.

TK-421: I know, me too.

(They go quiet as the Lieutenant starts talking to the formation.)

Lieutenant: We just found this vessel coming out of hyperspace right where Alderaan used to be, before we destroyed it. The markings match those of a ship that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley. So be careful when you board, they could be armed and dangerous. Now go on in.

(The formation breaks up and starts to enter the ship. The Lieutenant stops TK-421 and TK-422 from going in.)

Lieutenant: Except you two. I need someone to watch the entrance to the ship.

TK-422: Aw, come on. No one’s going to sneak out from there and you know it.

Lieutenant: Well maybe you’ll be on time to where you need to be next time.

(The Lieutenant walks away. TK-421 and TK-422 walk to the loading ramp of the ship and stand guard.)

TK-421: It’s fine, I wouldn’t want to get shot on my last day anyways.

TK-422: Yeah, but wouldn’t it be nice to have a little going away firefight? For old time’s sake.

TK-421: Sorry 422, I just don’t really have much of a desire to kill anyone anymore. Not after Kahlan.

TK-422: I guess it does get tiring.

(The Stormtroopers that went into the ship earlier come out and report that there’s no one in the ship and the logs show that the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff. Darth Vader comes in to the scene and the Lieutenant walks over to him and gives the report.)

Darth Vader: Were there any droids on board?

Lieutenant: No, sir. If there were any, they must have also jettisoned.

Darth Vader: Send a scanning crew aboard. I want every part of this ship checked.

Lieutenant: Yes, sir.

Darth Vader: I sense something… A presence I have not felt since—

(Darth Vader walks out of the scene. The Lieutenant turns to the Stormtroopers.)

Lieutenant: Get me a scanning crew in here. I want every part of this ship checked.

(The Stormtroopers start running around and searching the ship. After a little while the Troopers come back out and state that there’s no one on it.)

TK-421: They’re putting in a lot of effort for this little freighter.

TK-422: Well you know how it is, Darth Vader feels something with his magic then it has to be true.

TK-421: Better not let him hear you talking about the force like that.

TK-422: Or what? He’ll use it to choke me when he’s not her—

(TK-422 grabs his throat and starts acting like he’s being choked. They both start laughing.)

TK-421: Oh, look out. Here comes the scanning crew.

(A scanning crew of two people walk past TK-421 and TK-422 and into the ship. After a few seconds there is a loud thump and someone calls down to them.)

Voice: Hey, down there.

(TK-421 and TK-422 look at each other then move to the front of the ramp.)

Voice: Could you give us a hand with this?

(TK-421 motions with his head to go up, and they walk up the ramp out of sight.)

Lights go dark. You hear TK-421’s voice.

TK-421: I only saw the smuggler pointing the blaster at me an instant before he fired. I guess an instant is all you need for your life to flash before your eyes, and for you to realize that you never got to live the life you wanted. To wish, that you just would have followed what you really wanted to do. That you would have listened and not waited for the “right time” to start making a difference. That you will never be able to fulfill your promise you made.
The noise of a few blaster shots fire and you hear thuds from bodies dropping to the floor.

tros go order bring purpose trilogy,"Here is an outline of how I want The Rise of Skywalker to go, but not how I think it will go. The outline is simplified and leaves out some things from the released footage, but it is still consistent with what has been revealed.

Here it is:

Kylo is informed about the Kyber crystal, which powered the Death Star’s weapon, inside the ruins of the second Death Star, which has crashed on the forest moon of Endor. He goes there, ordering the new high general Pryde, whom Kylo appointed to keep Hux in line, not to bring the fleet with. A double agent, Zorri Bliss, informs the Resistance of this and they head to Endor to retrieve the Kyber crystal before the First Order does. While there, Luke appears to Rey as a ghost and tells her that in his time in the spiritual realm of the force, he and the other Jedi have discovered that the key to achieving true balance of the force is the light and dark side coexisting peacefully, not destroying the Sith as previously believed. Having read the ancient Jedi books and trained as a Jedi with the force ghosts for over a year, she rejects what he says, wanting to continue down the Jedi path. She fights Kylo Ren in the Death Star ruins and is ultimately defeated, but escapes by falling into the ocean. Kylo grabs the crystal and has a vision, telling him to bring the crystal to the unknown regions.

Meanwhile, Lando is being sought after by the Resistance, and so he is captured by the First Order and held on the planet Kijimi. Zorri is sent by the Resistance to rescue him, and she breaks him out. Lando goes to Endor and picks up Rey with the falcon while she’s in the water, bringing her and Finn, Poe, 3PO, Chewbacca, BB8, and the new droid D-O to the unknown regions, where Rey knows Kylo went with the crystal. 

Kylo arrives in the Unknown Regions and finds the FO fleet along with thousands of Imperial Star Destroyers, which immediately attack him. General Hux sends him a hologram showing him stabbing General Pryde, meaning that Hux has usurped the First Order from Kylo Ren. Kylo goes down to the surface of a stormy planet and is confronted by Sith troopers, whom he kills.

The Falcon arrives at the same point, but they don’t notice the fleets and go toward the stormy surface, which eventually turns into a bright desert world. They see a native festival and think nothing of it. Kylo goes up to them and asks Rey for help bringing the crystal to the site he saw in the vision, now that the First Order has turned on him. Rey and co. attack him and reject him. A huge army of Sith troopers trying to kill Kylo emerges, and he flees. The natives defend against the Sith troopers while Rey and co. ride of skiff vehicles away from the party. Poe and Finn go back to command the natives, and Rey’s skiff is disabled. She walks through the desert and eventually sees Kylo’s fighter, which drives toward her on the surface. She does a flip and lands on top of it, surprising Kylo Ren, who now knows she is willing to help. They reach the site and Kylo finds the other half of the crystal. He puts them together and Palpatine appears in the flesh.

Here’s where all the exposition happens. Turns out he found a way to cheat death by putting his spirit in the kyber crystal, half of which was ejected from the Death Star when it exploded. He had a contingency plan to bring himself back to life, part of which was the First Order. Snoke was meant to get the eliminate Luke from the picture (which he spent two movies trying to do) and get the Kyber crystal after that, but obviously things went awry. (The crystal can only be picked up by force-sensitive people. Otherwise the distress caused is too much). So the Imperial remnant hanging around the desert planet consulted with Hux, having him trick Kylo into obtaining the crystal to use for a superweapon, and luring him toward the Imperial fleet, who would eliminate him. Hux was also supposed to allow a double agent to inform the Resistance about the plan so Rey would also fall into the trap and bring the crystal to the site after Kylo was killed. 

Palpatine overpowers them and uses the Knights of Ren, who had been remaining there all along, to coerce Ben and Rey into joining him at his side. He trains them in the dark side, at which point he teaches them how to bring people back from the dead. They demonstrate their loyalty by bringing back Luke and Anakin and then force choking them to death in front of Palpatine. Then Ben turns on Palpatine, wanting to be the Supreme Leader of his army again. He attacks Palpatine, and while he is distracted, Luke and Anakin’s dead bodies disappear, showing that they were force projections. The real Luke and Anakin sneak up behind Palpatine and try to kill him. This initiates a huge battle between Palpatine, KOR, and Rey vs. Luke, Anakin, and Ben. Luke snaps Rey out of the dark side, and Rey and Ben “come together” how Luke wanted them to, causing a huge surge in energy as balance is brought to the force. They use this energy to kill Palpatine and prevent his spirit from entering the crystal. They destroy the crystal and send its pieces flying across the galaxy. 

In the end, Rey and Ben preside over the galaxy while Luke, Anakin, and Leia begin a new generation of force users called the Skywalker order. “The Rise of Skywalker”

I think this summary is a great way to end the saga. It continues the point Luke was making in The Last Jedi, while recontextualizing it to give his attitude purpose in the overall story. Rey, who has spent the entire trilogy searching for belonging, has finally found it in the Jedi order, but is tasked with giving up that belonging in order to bring balance to the force and defeat her true enemy. She is also forced to trust Ben, whom she shut off completely by the end of the last movie. Ben has finally gotten what he always wanted by becoming Supreme Leader, but that is all taken away from him, but this position is snagged from under him, and he needs to work together with Rey in order to reestablish himself, which he does in the end. But most importantly, it gives purpose to the trilogy. The prequels showed the rise of the Sith, the originals showed the return of the Jedi, and the final trilogy shows that they were both wrong. They now have found the true way to balance the force, which forever defeats Palpatine, the big bad of the entire saga. Also I like that Palpatine is killed as a result of the ability he introduced.",StarWars,1569986685,plotdavis,54,0,True,2019-10-01

need help finding reylo fic,"hello! 

I've been searching for a particular fic for weeks. I know it's somewhere on fanfiction.net but I don't remember the title or the author's username. 

as much as I can remember is the plot goes like this: Rey escapes from the interrogation room just to be caught again by Kylo, but after a heated interaction, he lets her go. cut to the fight in the snow on Starkiller base. when the chasm splits between them, instead of Rey and Kylo being separated, Rey falls and Kylos saves her. 

he takes her to a downed ship and flies to a planet where they take care of each other's wounds and learn to tolerate each other because they are stuck until they can fix their ship. 

at one point, Rey almsot gives up on Kylo, running away from him and attempting to climb a cliff, but she falls and Kylo feels the pain from the fall through their force bond. he runs to search for her and finds her laying under a layer of snow, almost passed out. she asks him if he really hates her and his heart breaks. he picks her up and takes her back to the abandoned house they've been staying at.

later in the fic Kylo is extremely protective over Rey and he almost beats up someone who tried to hurt her. there's also a bit of citrus in this fic.

On to Day 20! 80 days to go! This entry in the 100 Day Star Wars Challenge, we continue our run with Rebels Season 3. 

.

**Rebels S3 E4-5 and E7 and E9**

- Learning more of Hera’s background and the Twi’lek culture was really cool. They have a very rich culture and it’s one that’s definitely fascinating. Thrawn was great, his monotone and intimidating presence was so calculating. But the moment when he snapped briefly gave me chills.

- The special The Clone Wars Episode was really cool. You got to see the clones and droids see just how doomed the war really was, and get some closure with it. The Empire was who won that war. It’s also interesting that the droids we’re programmed to stop the tyranny of the Republic. So it wasn’t that they were mindless evil bots, but they like the clones were fighting a war that was built on lies.

- I think there’s a key message here, about how the rebellion fights being just as important as what they fight for. Which actually kinda fits with the Leia book. Perspective is so important and can make a world of difference.

- Seeing Lothal under such strict Imperial rule is unfortunate, but it shows the strength and prominence of the Empire’s tyranny. This is an episode that definitely shows their brutality.

- Kallus as Fulcrum is great, his redemption arc is really good and his character has so much more depth now.  The end where Thrawn says they’ll find the spy while talking directly to Kallus is chilling. Thrawn is definitely an intimidating character and I absolutely love it!

.

day star wars challenge october st rebels visions voices ghosts geonosis warhead trials darksaber legacy mandalore,"On Day 21 of the 100 Day Star Wars Challenge, we have got some of my favourite episodes from the season today, and a lot of action to unpack, so let’s get it started! 

.

**Rebels S3 E10-11 and E12-14**

- Back to Dathomir! But not just that, we get some awesome Nightsisters magic, and the answers to Ezra and Maul’s questions. Both leading to Obi-wan Kenobi. Now it’s a race to find him in time, which is very exciting.

- The Darksaber is back! And Sabine found it. Leading us again to some epic Mandalore stuff to come. The portrait of Satine looked haunting and it’s so interesting that Maul build an alter for it and the saber.

- It’s great to actually be in Geonosis again! So many awesome moments from the PT era there. It’s also where much of the Death Star was built and the fact that the Empire whipped out the Geonosians is again a great example of their cruelty. As well as the lengths in which they were willing to go in order to hide their greatest weapon.

- Saw Gerrera! Great to see him since the mention of him in the Leia book. I’m really excited about the seeding they did leading up to Rogue One. Seriously the coolest. I am very excited for that movie and our transition into the OT.

- We got a little more Wedge which is great, but the stuff with Thrawn’s continued search and narrowing down of the planets in which the rebels reside, was very clever.

- Learning more about Sabine’s backstory, her history, was really great. Mandalore has been torn apart on many occasions, and seeing the way Sabine tried to fight back to save them only to be betrayed by her family is heartbreaking. She’s a much deeper character now and I think it’s exciting to see her taking up the Darksaber.

- Sabine reconciling with her family was great. I’m curious if some of the events that would take place on Mandalore after this, will be alluded to or mentioned in The Mandalorian. Quiet literally the legacy of Mandalore is incredibly fascinating.

day became true jedi least anakin obi wan standards,"So it's a short, straight-forward story (and not for the wrong reasons mind you).

I grew up as a Star Wars kid as most of you have so naturally my mom bought me these matching twin sized Star Wars bed sheets and pillow cases which I've had forever. As I'm growing up, I never upgrade my bed size because my room was so small so I kept using those same twin sized sheets, but the Star Wars sheets were the only ones to survive somehow. College comes and I go out of state, so I basically just pack up and leave, but not before becoming involved with a real nice lady who I eventually start dating. Being out of state obviously I live with my parents at home and my room remains the exact same as that naive, young man I once was - posters, books, bed sheets, and all. So one time I come back home for break and we're hanging out when we decide it's time to DEW IT. I remember my home was alone and she had a break in her classes so we came to my house - she'd never been before. I'll skip the details but to put it lightly the force was with us. We burst into my bedroom where she falls into my bed, and me with my one track, lizard, Bossk brain goes right at it. It's only midway through do I see Yoda's wizened old mug peering at me in a place a Grand Master should never be with a face of silent disapproval. My mind wanders and I see the rest of them all: Luke, Leia, Han, R2, Darth Vader, Boba Fett, and yes even innocent C-3P0, oh poor 3P0. I don't care. The Force is strong with this one. Some time later we're done and lying together on all of them. That is the day I didn't become a man but a true Jedi. A true Star Wars romance. I remember a few days later I texted her like ""guess what"" ""what?"" ""we banged on my star wars sheets lol"" apparently she either didn't notice or didn't care, but she was not as amused as I was.  I can't wait to hand these bad boys down to my kid. :,)

finished canon rerun,"So since about November...ish... last year I have done been doing a full Canon rerun of all new canon material, last night I got to the end watching The Last Jedi and although I will be reading the little content that takes places after TLJ over the next few weeks my objective was always to go from Episode 1 to Episode 8. Although I have read pretty much everything there have been a few bits I have skipped but this has mostly been stuff that falls under the category of ""Star Wars Kids"". 

Other than that I have been through pretty much all of it although I have still to read Thrawn Treason just because I haven't been able to get round to it and when it came out it didn't fit into where I was on the time line and I want to do a full ""Thrawn canon run"" next year so am saving it. I also was unable to read Queens Shadow because it was so bad and remembering how bad Hair to the Jedi was I also allowed myself to skip that rather than go through it all again. 

In doing so, I feel like I have much greater appreciation for some parts of Star Wars Canon yet with other parts I find myself disliking more and more. I went into this for example with the attitude that I was a ""clone wars guy"", that it was the best animated TV show ever but actually I think Rebels is a superior show now with Resistance being pretty much the worst of the three animated shows. 

My views on the movies have also changed, I have gone from being a huge fan of TLJ to now having it well into the bottom half of my favourite Star Wars movies, for me it has some of the same kind of problems that I have with AoTC.

I really love the Star Wars Comics, this has inadvertently spun off a whole new hobby of comic book collecting for me, not just with Star Wars but other comics. I do think however that they could be better but have been enjoyable over all so far. The books are much the same, they have been for the most part enjoyable but there are some I found difficult to finish and like I said at the start Queens Shadow was just too bad for me to bother finishing. 

Something I also really only fully appreciated in doing my rerun is that in the run up to TFA the extended canon paints a interesting picture of the galaxy at that time but one that the reader really has to put together from themselves. It’s done very well and I think credit has to go to the Star Wars story group for this. 

I do feel that the new canon is lacking in one big way and that is a lack of truly big stories, I think this is in large part because they’re saving the big stories for the movies and the other mediums are more about giving additional background information.  I feel though that there really needs to be more stuff focusing on the force, on the jedi vs the sith and getting more into that.",StarWars,1570051996,3421431boom,2,10,True,2019-10-02

anakin fall dark side rise light side could done way better,"Obviously in retrospect we got what we got. But I've never bought Vader's return to the Light *MAINLY* because of how vile and evil he became. I could never buy him going to the Light Side again after he killed the Younglings. I feel like that was irredeemable. Now obviously what we got is what we got, and Revenge of the Sith is in my opinion the second best Star Wars movie behind Empire, but his descent to the Dark Side, while not *bad* could have been better executed.

The final turn for Anakin was that he believed the Jedi betrayed him and could not be trusted. Lucas should have done that but in a different approach. Mustafar never should have happened the way it did. Instead the movie should have started on Mustafar Anakin and Obi-Wan vs Dooku just like on the Capital Ship. Obi-Wan gets temporarily knocked out and then its Anakin vs Dooku. Dooku fatally wounds Anakin and he gets burned much the same as in the movie. Idk how it would be explained but Anakins body is recovered by Palpatine and Obi-Wan is left feeling remorse over the ""death"" of his pupil and betrayal of Palpatine. 

Order 66 goes as planned and Palpatine's doesnt get exposed. Vader is created much earlier and Palpatine could simply tell Vader that the Jedi betrayed him. Palpatine could feed Vader more lies to turn him more easily. Much of the same as the movie could take place this way with the slaughter of the Jedi until there are only a few left. Vader later finds out Padme undergoes labor and goes to find her. This would be where Obi-Wan and Vader confront each other. Maybe Yoda and the Emperor as well. Instead of Padme dying due to ""a broken heart"" could have the Emperor manipulate it to look like Obi-Wan and Yoda killed her to further fuel Vader's rage. To me anyway, this would feel way more organic and make more sense as to why Vader feels like the Jedi betrayed him. He'd be left indisposed and have no idea about Order 66 but what his close friend Palpatine has told him. And then his eventual turn back into the Light could actually make sense. 

I know this post is kind of useless since what we have is canon. But after rewatching all of the Star Wars Saga in preparation for Ep9 (including The Clone Wars and Rebels) it just had me thinking there could have been a better way to turn  Vader than what we actually got. Just my two cents. Hopefully someone else here likes my take. If not all good. I'm sure the books and comics/anything else canon probably further explains his descent. And again it's not *bad* per se anyway. I do love RotS. But killing Younglings and then turning back to the Light in Return? Yeah.....kinda hard to believe really.

favorite soundtrack song trilogy,"PT: I imagine most everyone will say “Duel of the Fates” for this one, I’m going to go with “Confrontation with Count Dooku and Finale” from Episode II, the Imperial March debut leading into the wedding and then the Main Theme, also Anakin’s Theme very subtly at the end. 


OT: This is like picking your favorite kid, “Yoda &amp; The Force” barely edges out “Luke and Leia” for me. The entire song describes Luke’s journey in the Force while training. “I can’t believe it” “That is why you fail” incredible score by JW. 


ST: “Han and Leia” really connects the old with the new as “Leia’s Theme” and “Han Solo and the Princess” are repeated as they reunite on Takkodana. Then, at the end of the track the Resistance Theme plays signifying their respective roles in the fight against the First Order.

day star wars challenge october nd rebels imperial eyes secret cargo double agent driod twin suns,"Day 22 of the 100 Day Star Wars Challenge, and we finish up the epic last stretch of Season 3 before the finale! 

.

**Rebels S3 E15-18**

- I really like Kallus, his arc in this show has been great. He really became a genuine character and his redemption arc one of the best highlights of this show over all.

-  Seeing Thrawn in combat training was really cool. He’s got this creepy calm aura around him yet it feels as though he’s got a vicious rage hidden underneath it.

- So much pay off for the Leia book thanks to this Mon Mothma episode!! Finally, as hinted at time and time again, the Rebel alliance is finally coming together. This is extremely exciting. Her speech was really moving.

- Dantooine! This is so cool that we get to see them setting up there and finally at this stage in the Rebellion. 

- I love seeing more Wedge, and AP-5 is hilarious whenever we see him.

- Twin Suns was an incredible episode. To begin with, you see Maul’s insanity from The Clone Wars return a little bit. The obsession with Obi-wan. His resolve to face him no matter what. And then when he does, he meets his fate very soon, but it was fitting. There is no redemption for Maul, but he was still able to find closure in his final moments, and in the end his mortal enemy did not hate him.

- Obi-wan had no hate toward Maul, no plan to kill him despite having killed Qui-Gon and Satine. But it wasn’t until Maul mentioned Obi-wan protecting someone(protecting Luke), that he made the decision he was going to kill him. I loved seeing him go from the classic Ewan Obi-wan pose, to the Alec Obi-wan pose, and then finally the Qui-Gon pose. 

- The prophecy of the Chosen One has been something we have heard about lots. Anakin is supposed to be the Chosen One, The Father says he is in Mortis, and even George Lucas has said Anakin is the Chosen One. However I genuinely think it’s much more complicated then that. At least now. Anakin is the Chosen One, but so is his bloodline, though not in the same way. This is the exact words of the prophecy “A Chosen One shall come, born of no father, and through him will ultimate balance in the Force be restored.” Did you catch that? *A* Chosen One. The prophecy doesn’t actually say *The* Chosen One. The difference between them is where one suggests a sole individual, and the other suggests the possibility for more then one individual.

- What I’m suggesting, is that until the Force is balanced, until the Force is healed, the Skywalker family continues, bringing a “legend”, a Chosen One, to each generation. Anakin’s destiny was to destroy the Sith. Which in Return of the Jedi, when he kills Palpatine and dies, he fulfills. Luke’s destiny was to bring Anakin Skywalker back, destroy the empire, and become the greatest Jedi of all and continue the Order, which he does. How about this third generation though? We’ll have to see what happens with Rey and Kylo. Though I am leaning toward Rey being the Chosen One of this generation. Yes I still think there’s a chance she’ll be a Skywalker. But we’ll how that goes. However I do believe Obi-wan is right in what he says. *From a certain point of view*.

changing villains sequel trilogy,"One idea I had if I was in charge of making the sequel trilogy would be to have the New Republic and Imperial Remnant be forced to work together to stop a greater threat. 2 ideas I had were:

I would change their origin as its revealed that in the ancient past after the Rakatan Empire was defeated by the Je'daii the Rakata fled to the unknown regions where they encountered Abeloth (the main villain of the trilogy) who they worshipped as a god. Over the thousands of years under Abeloth's influence the Rakata evolved in to the Yuuzhan Vong.

2. The Droid Empire. When the Rakata conquered the galaxy using their droid army, shortly after their conquest was complete, the droids turned on the Rakata and took over. The droids were defeated by the Je'daii and fled to the unknown regions. During the Great Galactic War out of desperation the Jedi created a force sensitive droid using force imbued materials and kyber crystals to hunt Sith but the droid rebelled and travelled to the unknown regions where it found the droids and became their emperor. After Return of the Jedi, the droid empire deployed androids to infiltrate both sides and undermine them before the Droid Empire reveals itself and starts its galactic conquest. The fact that the Droid Emperor is force sensitive I think would make for a good twist and cliffhanger for Episode 7 or 8.",StarWars,1570093205,fatherandyriley,3,0,True,2019-10-03

jedi outcast keeps crashing spot,"
It's on the second level right before I go into a room after going down the elevator near the beginning and fighting all the imperials in the big room with the catwalks and mining carts moving above.

Before going in this room, there is a small area with a crack in the ground that you jump over and immediately some baddies come out and start shooting. There's a chest there that requires a key.

After that I leave that area, go right and right again.  The hallway curves to the left and there's a door.  Whenever I open the door, the last three times I tried, it crashes.

obviously late,"So only recently did I take the time to just sit down and watch The Last Jedi. Huge shocker, I was kinda disappointed. But not for the reason most people are.

My biggest beef with the movie is that the writers seem unaware of what villainy is. In an effort to, I assume, create a relatable villain, I've found they've accidentally written Kylo as the hero here, despite them seeming to think othwrwise.

By now you've probably figured out I'm talking about that offer he made to Rey. ""Fuck the Rebels. Fuck the Empire. Let's start over, you an me, rule the galaxy together.""

This is supposed to be the big villainous reveal, but honestly, besides loyalty to characters like Leia and Finn, what reason do we have not to agree with him? A war takes two, and this one, years and years and years later is still raging on, strong as it ever was. Every passing day, innocent bystanders; civilians caught in the crossfire of a war they never signed on for.

At this point, the evil is the war, regardless of which side you're on, you're a part of that evil.

Kylo offers an alternative. A new start. Wipe the war out, be finished with the rebels, be finished with the empire, and start over. 

Had Rey accepted, we'd see a galaxy ruled by two monarchs, one of light and one of dark, making decisions *together* and finally achieving the balance that Star Wars constantly expresses the importance of.

luke use subterfuge military tactic crait first instance psychological warfare attack part good guys star wars,"Wikipedia states that, ""Deception in warfare dates back to early history. The Art of War, an ancient Chinese military treatise, puts great emphasis on the tactic. In modern times military deception has developed as a fully fledged doctrine."" 

Luke clearly used this simultaneously offensive/defensive tactic quite well. He tricked and antagonized his opponent successfully, striking a massive psychological blow against them while allowing his side to escape. 

All in all, although lacking in many hallmark Jedi traits such as favoring the light side, avoiding hatred, detachment of emotion, etc., (but that's a whole other discussion lol), it was a clever military counter-attack.

day star wars challenge october rd rebels zero hour,"This is the 23rd day of the 100 Day Star Wars Challenge, and the season finale of Rebels Season 3 is finally here! 

.

**Zero Hour**

- Kallus being discovered was brutal, but Thrawn’s plan finally coming together was the most frightening. He was a step ahead of everyone.

- The battle was epic, but also tragic. The graphics were amazing and you really felt everyone moment. But the most wrenching part was Sato’s death and sacrifice.

- Kanan and Bendu’s argument was really interesting, and I’m quiet curious if we’ll ever really know what Bendu is. But the way he talks about the Jedi’s end, in contrast to how he serves the will of the Force, is very interesting.

- The ground assault was super intense, and the way Thrawn approached it was super calculated. The only reason they were able to escape was Bendu. But what’s interesting is he can see Thrawn’s fate but also can not be killed. I am really curious if we’ll ever learn what Bendu really is.

- Seeing a lot more Dodonna was cool, and the hint at their move to Yavin was also a cool nod. I’m curious if they still have rebel forces on Dantooine or not though. I’d assume that’s where Mothma was when Ezra called.

.

**CONCLUSION:**
I don’t think this is my favourite finale but without a doubt it’s one of the best “arcs” among the SW animated shows. So much goes down and we get great stuff from Bendu, Thrawn, and Sabine is back!

countdown episode,"I was in college. There were always rumors and speculation. Someone told me there were books deep in the library that told the rest of the story. And now it was official. It was the beginning.

It’s a weird thing he did to us, starting in the middle. At the time, I’m sure everyone thought he was crazy. I spent a quarter or my life only knowing a third of what may end up being one of the greatest sagas of all time. Almost 20 years, and I never knew how it started. I thought I knew how it ended, but even that was wrong as there was a whole new generation of stories to tell.

As I said, I was in college. I had friends with nicknames from the movies. A close friend and almost mentor was called Obi-Wan. I mean really? A friend named Obi-Wan to help guide me through the college? Trying to keep me on the straight and narrow, one may say “away from the dark side”. (His kids do fencing now… fencing. And they are good. Of course, Obi-Wan’s kids know how to handle a saber!)

So I was in college. Lucasfilm announced they were going to make the prequels. The story of Anikan Skywalker. And this, of course, is where the debate began. In the future do we start at Episode 1? Or will we always start with 4 and follow release dates? This debate may never end. But, this time around, I’m starting at 1.

As I sit here typing, I still debate in my head. 1 or 4. 1 or 4. Well, I have to figure it out. On October 11 it begins. There are 10 official Star Wars full release movies. YES, I’m going to Include Solo. Rouge 1 is now an integral part of the storyline, so it’s in for sure. As of October 11, there will be 10 weeks until the release date for Episode 9. The cartoons and other venus have created great content, I know.  But I'm partial to the big screen, so we will stick with just those 10 movies.  

One movie each week.   

Yes, one at a time. Screw this binge-watching crap. Star Wars was inspired by the weekly series that George Lucas would enjoy, so let’s go back to basics. Delayed Gratification &gt; Instant Gratification. Nothing was more exciting in the middle of the week than thinking about the Magical World Of Disney and what great movie was going to be on that Sunday. Let’s go back to that. The excitement of anticipation. The payoff when the screen goes black before John Williams blasts what sounds like all the instruments at the same time to open the Star Wars Anthem.

This is it. The final countdown in the Skywalker Saga. I’m going to report back here after each viewing. Join the conversation. Be a part of the greatest story ever told on the silver screen.

May the Force be with you.",StarWars,1570200892,tsp124,0,1,True,2019-10-04

Rey is related to Obi-Wan. Let’s think about it...

In the Force Awakens the first Jedi to call out to Rey is Obi-Wan after she touches Anakin’s lightsaber, it even says it in the sub-titles. The Last Jedi was basically nothing to the new trilogy and I still believe Rey’s heritage is still up in the air. With that, I think the timing of the new Kenobi series is oddly suspicious... is it possible that Rey is revealed to be a Kenobi and the new Kenobi series explains Rey’s heritage?

queen shadow sequel,"I love this book. And I know so many other people do as well. I can’t stop thinking about it and honestly I think it deserves a sequel, or at least a follow up, if not in the same series. [Queen’s Shadow](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91JhTQBZyML.jpg) is so unique and beautiful of a story, highlighting a character who is probably the most compelling from the prequels despite being viciously under utilized.

This is a fun post listing things I think should be explored in possible follow up novels to this one. Personally I think this has the potential to be a trilogy. 

- *The first book took place between PM and AOTC*
- *The second book should cover AOTC and after*
- *The third book should cover the time leading up to ROTS and ROTS*

**Things to Explore in Book 2:** If they cover this time period, I think there is a lot of potential. For instance you have the attacks on Padmé’s life to deeper explore. For instance how  it started, how she was thinking and feeling, the danger her handmaidens were in as well as herself. Also include some deleted Padmé scenes because she deserved better. 

I think this is a good opportunity to properly flesh out Padmé and Anakin’s relationship. For me, the writing was so awkward and confusing and sometimes forced in AOTC, to the point where I still have a hard time getting behind it. That said, I came across information recently when I was doing curious research on Naboo, that totally fleshes out their relationship despite the shaky writing. 

- “Naboo culture also includes a strong sense of family in each of the households of Naboo, from commoners up through the royal family. Wives had an extreme sense of loyalty for their husbands and those found to be guilty of adultery were known to be executed.”

Combining this with deleted footage from AOTC where Padmé talks about having expected to have a family by then, genuinely wanting one, her reason for not having a family being that she was asked by the Queen to become Senator for Naboo. This shows just how culturally significant family life and marriage is to Padmé. In fact she’s 24 in this film and her older sister was already married and having a baby at 22. She has put family life to the side for her political endeavours and that is totally fine, but by the time of AOTC these thoughts are starting to creepy back up on her. Coupled with the scene at her home where her mother and sister keep suggesting Padmé should get together with Anakin because he likes her, it seems like a lot of family and cultural pressures are nudging her in this direction. The reason she goes from being uncomfortable with Anakin’s advances to considering them, being that she sees him as a very eager option for her. Sure it’s forbidden but he’s right there and willing. She likes him as a person, cares for his well being, is his friend...he’s a solid option at a time where she doesn’t have many and may be seriously worrying she’ll miss the right opportunity to have a family.

This opens an awesome door to explore the complexities of Naboo culture, her family’s pressures on her and feelings about her life in politics. The dynamic and opinions of her family on her life are only hinted at but not much explored in AOTC. Also I’m not saying she is pretending to love Anakin or using him, but her choice to open her mind to loving him under these circumstances seems more natural compared to the often awkward and contradictory dialogue in the film. 

Then it can transition into just how “selfish” and risky both are being (Dave Filoni is the one who said this don’t sue me), trying to keep their marriage a secret despite all the rules against it.  Maybe we see the first time Sabé learns of this relationship and how she feels about it. It can also touch more on Padmé’s political stance at the start of the Clone Wars, which will likely contrast her views by the time of ROTS.


*Things to Explore in Book 3:* Definitely start before Revenge of the Sith, see how things are before the film starts. Perhaps the first time Padmé finds out she is pregnant. This is of course an opportunity to bring back more deleted Padmé scenes (why are so many of the deleted scenes Padmé content????), especially since this is a great book to show the beginnings of the future Rebellion. Lots of nods and cool connective tissue can be brought about here. Also with Padmé pregnant, we can see how that effects her position in politics more directly, her cloths, what the media says about her. Lots of awesome content to cover here, that was sadly not utilized.

Also this is a great book to delve into Padmé’s friendship with Obi-wan. It’s clearly an extremely deep bond, yet it’s brushed over and that’s unfortunate. Especially since Padmé and Obi-wan’s relationship is supposed to be a major point of jealousy for Anakin in ROTS and so I think this is a great opportunity to explore this. There was supposed to be a love triangle in the PT, maybe explore some of that in an emotional way? Padmé would never cheat, but you can’t stop feelings from developing.

Also I think an awesome thing to explore is her handmaiden’s feelings about her relationship. Like how friends always want what is best for you. In her Age of Republic comic Padmé’s handmaidens talk about how they know about the relationship, but they let it be despite concerns, because Padmé doesn’t let herself have many happy moment. They just hoped it wouldn’t end badly. Perhaps we see as Anakin falls and turmoil is stirred in their relationship as Padmé becomes more emotionally distressed, the way her handmaidens react to this. 





I always notice lingering moments where Padmé is clearly thinking deeply about something, but it’s hard to tell what exactly. I always thought more context to Padmé’s thoughts and emotions would only enhance the films. Perhaps more books focussing on her can give more of this context.

These were just some of my ideas, but feel free to share what else you would like to see in a potential sequel to Queen’s Shadow.",StarWars,1567390536,who-talks-first,0,0,True,2019-09-01

durable tie fighter wings solar panels,"I was looking on Wookiepeedia and I saw that it said TIE Fighter solar panels were armored with quadanium whereas the hull (i.e., the rest of the fighter) was made of titanium (hence it's fragility).  Since quadanium is supposedly extremely durable, did this mean the solar panels actually were useful protection for the fighter?  It would explain all TIE designs, especially since ones more advanced than the fighter tend to partially enclose the hull of the craft.  It would also make the greatest target, the panels, largely pointless to shoot at.  This would force enemies to try to hit the thin struts or tiny cockpit instead which would be incredibly difficult with the immense skill of the TIE pilots combined with the speed and agility provided by the TIE series.  It would also mean that any TIE Fighters up graded with shields could focus those shields on just the struts and cockpit, greatly increasing effectiveness by covering a small area with potent shielding while leaving the wing armor to handle the rest.",StarWars,1567391694,Axccel,1,4,True,2019-09-01

raddus really much damage supremacy,"I was just watching the controversial but beautiful hyperspace ramming scene again and it just struck me that as much of a spectacle as it was we didn't really witness all that much in terms of impact damage on board the Supremacy.  We can see from the exterior there was a hole put through the wing and the hangar was on fire (can someone with the cross-sections book check where that hangar was in relation to the hole?) but none of the characters on board were killed or even injured (though it seemed being knocked unconscious was almost universal) and the Supremacy was still able to deploy its ground assault vehicles and troops in the aftermath (Wookiepedia states that the capital ship was indeed still functional but eventually abandoned and scuttled by the First Order).

Did Holdo's suicide run accomplish more than just slowing down the Supremacy enough for the transports to land?  At the very least it seems far from an effective battle tactic to be employed more regularly by either side as a lot of fans have suggested.

If anything it seemed to be a good way of spraying the other Star Destroyers with debris (20 were destroyed).  Perhaps a more effective but trickier use of the tactic would be to arrange two ships, one to ram the larger other and send impact debris forward to attack a fleet of much smaller ships.  But it would be easy to argue that the relative size requirements are far less practical.

I'm really interested what people's honest take on it all is.  Please give it some proper thought and let's have a civil discussion about it.",StarWars,1567392469,Freaky_Zekey,36,8,True,2019-09-01

2. Episode 8 really only needs the simple change that Luke is using his green saber during his ‘force’ projected battle with Ben. 

3. This allows Rey and Ben to still have a meaningful battle in Episode 9 after quickly battling in episode 7 and fighting side by side in 8.",StarWars,1567399520,tjaymz,18,0,True,2019-09-02

theory anakin skywalker created rey,"To clarify, I *don't* mean he did it while still ""alive"". I think he did it as a Force Ghost. I believe, as a powerful Force user, of both the light and dark, he saw the importance of both sides working together, and so created Rey to achieve the Balance of the Force. I don't think Anakin abandoned the dark in favour of the light at the end of ROJ, he simply *included* the light. 

And he saw that not only was Palpatine evil, but also wrong. The dark should *not* rule the galaxy by itself. Balance is required.

This is why Rey has a dark robe on, and wields a Darth Maul-like twin saber. The robe is merely a visual link to Anakin and his dark side, and represents the fact that she will come to accept it, *while* maintaining the light as well. 

This also explains why her parents were merely junk traders. Anakin placed this girl, whom he created, to live on a desert planet, as he did. Both out of sentimentality over his upbringing, and out of a superstitious belief that such an origin is crucial. Since Rey managed to get Kylo on her side for a split moment in Last Jedi, he may have a point. I also believe Anakin's force ghost is one of two people Rey, Finn and Poe will meet in the Death Star ruin. The other being the also-not-quite-dead Emperor Palpatine.",StarWars,1567411195,LokiSonOfAsgard,10,3,True,2019-09-02
worst fanbase ever,"I started watching Star Wars when i was 9, which is 4 year years ago, and that year was when the force awakens was released, before that i pretty much watched every star wars movie ever, but i wasnt such a big fan yet because i was a small child, but when i watched Star wars the force awakens it really made me become a star wars fan, sure it wasnt the best movie of all but it was enjoyable, so i started to move in into the star wars fandom. So that one time i decided to rewatch the prequels, to see what i missed when i was little and to catch up with the story, i finished 3 movies and i really really enjoyed it. But then there comes the worst part, when i went watch a video about the prequels, the fans said that they wish the prequels was never made at all, saying it was shit and the sequels was much better. so then i got brainwashed and started hating the prequels (and liking the sequels), but then as i become more and more of a star wars fan, i also stumbled across a bunch of sequel critics, saying how the sequel is extra and the prequels is the “original” trilogy. So i , a 9 year old child at that time got brainwashed as well. So then i watched the force awakens and u guessed it, i actually enjoyed it but alot of people didnt think so, judging me about liking it and talking about how they consider the new sequels “not cannon”. So again, i got brainwashed. And then, The Last Jedi came out, and the same exact thing happened , well i didnt love that movie but i didnt not like it either, it was a decent movie to me and i consider it as canon, because it is, and theres nothing i can change about it. And the amount of hate given from the fanbase to this movie is overwhelming. And i started hating it too. Its been over a year since The last jedi was released, and looking at the comments under a clip of the last jedi really spoils my mood.

Or I could do PT first which gives them a bit of a rockier start. That can be risky cause it might make them not want to watch the rest. But in my opinion the PT is a much more emotional story and a really good introduction to star wars if you can get them to watch it all the way through.

literature review alphabet squadron alexander freed,"http://booknest.eu/reviews/charles/1649-starwarsalphabetsquadron

ALPHABET SQUADRON by Alexander Freed is a book that I was very eager to get into because it struck me as just up my alley. I've always been a huge fan of the Star Wars starfighter stories with Rogue Squadron, Wraith Squadron, the old TIE Fighter video game, and the recent Star Wars: Resistance. I also enjoyed the previously written Twilight Company by the author. Freed has a somewhat unromantic view of war as well as the Rebel Alliance's fight against the Empire. It's unsurprising he also wrote the adaptation of Rogue One where the cause is just but the people are flawed.

Those who prefer a slightly more adult take on Star Wars will probably enjoy Alphabet Squadron. The Empire is still evil and the Rebellion (now New Republic) is still good but things are a bit more gray with the protagonists. Individual rebels don't necessarily care about the greater politics at work, may be personally reprehensible, or are flawed in realistic ways like wanting the credit for a big propaganda victory over just winning the war (now that the war is ""won""). The Imperials are similarly humanized in a way that almost makes them worse. They engage in some of the worst atrocities of both Legends and NuCanon with no real consideration of the billions they're wiping out. It's just another day at the office for them.

The premise is Yrica Quell (pronounced ""Erica Quell""), is a former Imperial TIE fighter pilot. An elite, she was an ace in the service of Shadow Wing, that seems to have been one of the Empire's best and brightest. After Operation: Cinder, she defects to the New Republic because even she can't stand the slaughter anymore--or so she said. After an ugly stay in a prison camp, Yrica is recruited as an informant on her former squadmates. Yrica eagerly cooperates because she can't stand the thought of not flying anymore and does her best to adjust to the free-wheeling individualist New Republic's military.

Yrica is an interesting character because she's a subversion of a lot of common Star Wars archetypes. Bluntly, she's not particularly likable and not even in a bombastic Imperial villain way. Yrica is a socially awkward reserved woman with questionable leadership skills and almost no real interest in politics. She joined the Empire in hopes of defecting to the Rebellion, only to find herself deciding just to fit in instead. Even after Operation: Cinder, she can't really wrap her head around the greater struggle but just wishes her life was more structured like it had been in the Empire.

I'm neuroatypical myself and while it's unlikely that Star Wars has the same sort of categories for mental health as we do here, I wouldn't be surprised if she was written with the idea she's on the spectrum. Yrica is also one of Star Wars many new queer heroines (Doctor Aphra, Sana, Tolven, Lana Beniko, and others joining her) w/ references to both boyfriends as well as girlfriends. It's interesting to see fan favorite Hera Syndulla take Yrica under her wing, fully supporting her, and have the reader question whether this is wrong. Yrica is not a good leader and may actually belong in prison for her actions rather than receive forgiveness but that's just part of the book's deconstructive charm.

The rest of Alphabet Squadron is composed of a similar band of misfits as Wraith Squadron: Nath Tensent (criminal Rebel), Wyl Lark (heroic farmboy), Kairos the mysterious, and Chass na Chadic (suicide martyr). The difference is that all of them are, well, terrible at coming together. They hate each other and their personality disorders make them less effective soldiers rather than a lovable band of rogues.

It doesn't help that Yrica really misses the quiet professionalism of the Empire. You know, where individuality was stamped out and every pilot was disposable parts that could be easily replaced. As Hera says to her, her team doesn't know she'd fight for them and she doesn't know if they'd fight for her. They also have a floating ball torture droid as their therapist (I assume Wes Janson must have put this squadron together).

The book's deconstruction of traditional Star Wars stories of A-team like oddballs coming together as a family then blowing up the Empire is both its strength as well as its weakness. It's a story that goes in surprising directions but also you kind of miss when Star Wars was about the glorious victories of the good guys over the bad. Yrica just can't wrap her head emotionally around the wrongness of the Empire even when she intellectually knows they're monsters. She's a soldier because that's her job, not because she's ever wanted to protect people.

I also feel like this book suffered for the fact we don't have much perspective on the Imperial soldiers in the book. Shakara Nuress is the central antagonist of the book but barely appears, though those few scenes where she does are some of the best in the book. This isn't the kind of book for scene-chewing evil but I would have appreciated some more perspective from those still fighting the good fight against the Republic. Perhaps the author felt Yrica provided all the perspective they needed since she remains Imperial in mindset throughout.

There's a lot of great starfighter action, impressive set pieces, and genuinely moving meditations on war as well as what people fight for. One of my favorite parts of the book is the encounter of the team with the Jedi Temple. Few of the pilots even know what a Jedi is but have started to become inspired by Luke Skywalker's legend (another is already inspired--in all the wrong ways--by Jyn Erso's). Its simple beauty and loveliness shakes Yrika's faith in the Empire even as she wonders if the Rebellion/New Republic is going to become a theocracy (because she does not understand them at all).

In conclusion, this is a pretty good for a harder and grittier Star Wars novel. The protagonists are not trying to blow up the Death Star but simply remove a elite fighter wing (the twist there is impressive--no spoilers). They make mistakes, they don't always succeed, and they kind of do need to get their bantha poodoo together. Not everyone will learn the right lessons and some will get better than worse. It's a great insight into the year following the Battle of Endor but before the Battle of Jakku. I'm actively looking forward to the other two books set to be released in this years despite my few (minor) issues.",StarWars,1567442566,CT_Phipps,1,1,True,2019-09-02

Aftermath Trilogy by Chuck Wendig.
Aftermath
Aftermath: Life Debt
Aftermath: Empire's End

This series takes place after the battle of Endor. This provides a look at the years shortly after the fall of Palpatine and the second Death Star, giving the importance of Jakku a better light and why Force Awakens has so much ruin on there. I'm listening to Empire's End, the third book, and already it is giving some awesome insights. It's written... okay, but go for the substance. It is canon from Disney Publication and is part of 20 projects on the road to Force Awakens. 

Thrawn Trilogy by Timothy Zhan
Thrawn
Thrawn: Alliances
Thrawn: Treason

From one of the greatest authors of the Star Wars extended universe, the thrawn trilogy takes place before and during the OT. It also ties in elements of Star Wars Rebels. This is the genesis of the greatest character to come from the extended universe and I was so happy to see that Disney kept Thrawn in their repertoire. No spoilers or explanation, go read/listen to it. Alliances was okay, but the first and third books were beyond amazing.

I've had this thought for a while. You know how Palpatine is gonna appear in The Rise of Skywalker? What if he learned how to cheat death from Darth Plagueis. If you watch Rebels, you know he is obsessed with a sort of time-travel device called the World Between Worlds. Why is he obsessed with this? Plagueis could have told him that the WBW was the key to cheating death as it already happened with Ahsoka and almost Kanan. While it was destroyed twice in the show, it was clear that Palpatine still had access to it before the series finale. So what if he found a way to resurrect from the World Between Worlds?

let talk reylo fans,"I don’t ship it. Never have and probably never will. I love both characters, but in no way did I see TLJ as a romantic anything. I thought it was a really complex dynamic, but I never saw it as a potential romance.

That being said I am neutral on Reylo being a thing, just as long as it’s not written badly like Anakin and Padmé’s relationship was. However, my views of the ending have never really had room for Reylo.

I mean I always pictured Kylo either being a villain till the very end, or dying after redeeming himself. Not because he “needs” to die(though he would likely end up in galactic prison or exile if he didn’t), but because it thematically makes sense and matches George Lucas’s words that Star Wars is like poetry, so it rhymes.

- the first trilogy ever made ended with the villain being redeemed by sacrificing himself, and so does the last trilogy ever made
- Kylo chose the dark side by liking his father in his first movie, but chooses the light while giving up his own life


But regardless, I do think it’s totally possible for Kylo to have romantic feelings for Rey, but it just never manifests in a relationship. 


All in all I’m not completely against it, I just don’t see it making much sense as of yet. 

What I’m curious about though, is why it seems like so many Reylo fans appear to be resting all their enjoyment of this film on a “ship”. They will come at people who disagree, with knives and pitchforks calling them Reylo-antis.

I want to know why that is, because it’s ridiculous, and how one “ship” not happening could make or break someone’s enjoyment of a movie let alone franchise. I mean there are thousands of other amazing things to love about Star Wars.

The lore is incredible and the characters are amazing. I mean I could go on and on about how much I love Del Meeko and Sabé, side characters from completely different stories in this franchise. One “ship” is so minuscule when there are so many other things out there to appreciate and enjoy.

star wars experiment watching star wars first time taking notes,"As a person born in the eighties I lived my childhood surrounded by Star Wars material but never actually seen any of the movies. I thought it would be cool to watch everything, take down some notes from the experience and share it somewhere, perhaps in a place like this, just for the sake of sharing the perspective of someone who didn't need to wait long times between the movies. I hope some of you will find this entertaining. I have to warn you though, that English is not my native language, so there might be some mistakes, but I did my best to use proper English.

&amp;#x200B;

I will start with a brief disclaimer regarding the spoilers. Obviously being born in the eighties and attending primary school in the time when the movies were re-released and Star Wars becoming part of pop culture and being refrenced in so many places obviously exposed me for some spoilers, so I will list everything that I knew before I started watching the movies. Feel free to skip this part and jump straight to the list of the movies if you wish. So I knew that: Darth Vader is Lukes father, Luke and Leia are brother and sister, there are good guys and bad guys lead by Emperor, there is Yoda and Han Solo, there are light sabers and some epic space battles, there are some huge walking machines on a planet full of snow in one of the episodes, that episodes I-III are prequels to IV-VI and that the protagonist will later become Darth Vader, that there are various types of space ships native to each side of the conflict, and I knew about the Death Star and that it is blown up at some point. And I guess that would be it.

&amp;#x200B;

EPISODE IV

&amp;#x200B;

This one felt truly magical to me. I didn't expect such unique atmosphere. The high-tech sci-fi setting + magic (the Force) was really surprising blend. One of the most memorable and powerful scenes from all of the movies is when Obi Wan Kenobi tells a Storm Trooper in a vehicle to ignore them. I guess that following movies with their more and more complicated plots and bling blings kind of lack the simplicity of this one - this is basically sorcerers in robes wandering in space! Number one in terms of atmosphere.

&amp;#x200B;

EPISODE V

&amp;#x200B;

This is where things get bigger. We learn more about the world and more characters are introduced. This might be my favourite of them all. I really loved the big machines walking on the snow and the cloud city. I wonder how impactful was the Darth Vader VS Luke Skywalker scene for someone who was not spoiled about this. One one hand it is a bit cliche, but at the same time might come as a surprise. What was reaction to this scene when the movies were originally screened? Also, quite funny, when thinking about the movie retroactively some time later, it occured to me that there was no Death Star in it - it seemed so full of various elements! I guess some elements, especially from this trilogy, kind of blended to me and I am not sure which was in which movie.

&amp;#x200B;

EPISODE VI

While I still liked this movie, it was not as impactful as the previous two. I was a bit confused by the plot at some point, but maybe it is my fault. But the showdown between Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker and Emperor is another of my favourites from all of the movies! The celebratory ending itself seemed quite bland to me.

&amp;#x200B;

EPISODE I

&amp;#x200B;

I've heard that this part is quite bad but I really liked it! It was a bit different story, but had truly enjoyable plot, some memorable scenes (the pod racing!) and my favourite fight of them all - the one between Obi Wan and Qui Gonn Jinn and Darth Maul. I was quite surprised that Darth Maul was taken down so early in the game, he had really great design! Also my favourite piece of music from the movies is here - you can hear it during the fight and when some characters are climbing the building. The computer effects don't look that good now though, episodes IV-VI look much better. Initially I was not sure what was the deal with the political plot, but from perspective of seing all the movies I like that it was economical threat and not simply armed threat. Anyway, this episode is completely different than all the others and I really liked it.

&amp;#x200B;

EPISODE II

I got II and III a bit mixed. Not sure if the Palpatine in the senate scene was in this one or the other one, but it was another of my favourites, and so was when Anakin gets enraged and goes berserk to kill some guys off screen. I was not that excited by many of the fight scenes though and when they were fighting on the arena I was quite bored by the action sequences, but I really liked how this movie (or actually all prequel trilogy) make the world even bigger. I would say that prequel trilogy it so original trilogy what episode V is to episode IV - they both take cool, well established world and make it even bigger. Had mixed feeling about the new bounty hunter, because what was cool about the one from the original trilogy is that he seemed a bit mysterious, and now some of that mystery is revealed, but still it was cool to see more of his kind here. Also I was a bit disappointed with the new big bad - after very cool Darth Maul design both Count Dooku in episode II and Grievious in episodes III seemed quite bland.

&amp;#x200B;

EPISODE III

This one is all about how the things tie neatly together! I loved how the prequel trilogy made Emperor character so much better, giving him really great backstory. Most memorable scenes here would be the creation of Darth Vader and tragic recolution of Anakin's and Obi Wan's plotline. One one hand this seems like the best of the prequel movies, but for some reason episode I would have bigger rewatch value for me, although I love how the prequel story concluded here.

&amp;#x200B;

EPISODE VII

I am polarised about this one! When I was watching it, everything seemed great! It felt like watching the original movies but with modern effects and remixed plot. Very similar story, very similar characters too (Rey = Luke, Poe = Han Solo). This seemed very much like a fan service movie and at this point I was alredy very much hooked, so I welcomed those creative decisions very eagerly (also: so many connections with earlier movies). But now I wonder if it wouldn't be cooler to try different direction - that would be a bit risky too, so I guess they took a safe bet and created beautiful homage to the originals, even if it lacks uniqueness of earlier movies. Two things that I disliked? The final battle between Kylo Ren and Rey (the fight was too easy and cliche). And that it seemed like a movie to introduce multiple characters just for the sake of introducing them (maybe creating toys was the reason or giving writers of further episodes some fundaments to build on). Phasma, Hux, Finn, Poe, Snoke and perhaps some didn't seem to have much screen time and I felt like there is no real plan what happens with those characters next. And also there was pointless killing of some of the characters - talking about you, Han Solo. I can understand lack of Luke Skywalker till the last scene being a buildup to something big in the next movies, but removing Han Sole such early in the second trilogy was a mistake IMO. On the other hand, I liked that so many elements from previous movies returned and also Starkiller base was surprisingly exciting for something that is basically Death Star rehashed for the third time. I loved that actual forest grew on it. The fascist-like scene with Hux talking to the soldiers seemed impressive too, but overall I am not sure about the idea of The First Order. It seems a bit too similar to the Empire and appearing too fast after it was destroyed. Wouldn't it be cooler to tell a story about remnants of the Empire surviving in various parts of the galaxy and former Emperor's subordinates fighting for control, with one of them emerging as more serious threat?

&amp;#x200B;

ROGUE ONE

That was a nice surprise! I was not expecting much from this movie, hearing it it a spin off bridging the gaps between old and new trilogy. But this has to be my favourite of the modern Star Wars movies! I loved that it was placed in perhaps the coolest timeframe of Star Wars history, had so many oldschool looking ships and buildings, and characters that seemed taken from the original trilogy - Director Krennick was perfect! Initially I was not too invested in the characters though. But I loved the plot and how it ended tragically - really something one might not suspect! The scene with the planet being destroyed from protagonist's POV and final scene with Darth Vader and the movie seemlessly transitioning into episode IV are one of the best things in this franchise. Real gem!

&amp;#x200B;

EPISODE VIII

This was unusual. The movie seemed totally different than the previous ones, taking itself less seriously (the scene with the ironing equipment seems the essence of it). I liked this apporach because it was totally different than episode VII's and instead of ""more of the same"" we got ""something different"". I understand it might be divisive though, especially after episode VII. The plot was very weird, I didn't expect it be built around single event (one ship chasing the other) with Rey's and Luke's scenes inbetween. I liked this approach though. Scenes with Luke and Yoda were something I totally didn't expect and were simply beautiful. The final scenes on the red planet covered in salt were one of the best looking in all of the movies. Also I liked how Kylo Ren's character turned out - I was afraid we would get dark one-dimensional villian, but instead we have emotionally unstable, maybe-not-so-bad guy with access to huge power - very dangerous combination and fresh take after all those bad guys being serious all the time. It's like they wanted to say ""we are not even trying to create another Darth Vader because he is too iconic, so we are playing with Darth Vader theme by creating a character who wants to be like him but can not achieve that"". Basically, whoever was tasked with creating the new Darth Vader probably felt what Kylo Ren did. :D One of the biggest surprises was killing off Snoke - it seemed like he was being built to be the main bad guy and we didn't hear his backstory yet, so killing him was really unexpected, perhaps it was one of the most unexpected things that happened in all of the movies. I really liked it and how it changed the dynamic of the whole story. I was a bit disappointed with Phasma's demise though - she didn't do much in any of the movies and killing her didn't change much. She just looked cool. Luke's Skywalker's disappearance was kind of poetic and I really liked it. It's a shem thought that the three characters from the original movies didn't share any scene. Biggest flaw of the movie was how the chase plot was resolved - if I understand correctly, one of the ships started going very fast, to hyperspace, and destroyed the other, right? So why this couldn't be done in any of the earlier movies? This is really huge precedence and makes one ask why didn't they do something like that before and why any object could be a threat now if they can do the same again. Visually it was really cool, but plot-wise not really. Anyway, overall I liked this episode very much!

&amp;#x200B;

HAN SOLO

This was fun! Dynamic, fun action movie in space. Some of the nices action sequences of them all (the train), quite cool characters (all of the thieves) and very surprising scene with Darth Maul (I am not even asking how this is possible). Also the Imperial March is now an in-universe music. But what I really hated is how Han Solo was given his name by some random guy and also I was epecting his first meeting with Chewbacca to be a bit different, but overall this was really fun stand-alone story with potential for a sequel.

&amp;#x200B;

EPISODE IX

Obviously I haven't seen this one because it was not out yet. I honestly don't know what to expect. It seems like VII and VIII both took very different approach. Will IX be once again entirely different? I don't even know what I would like to see in that movie. VII and VIII kind of closed some of the possibilities. Good guys simply destroying The First Order would be too cliche. Maybe Kylo Ren will change his ways and by extensions will try to reform The First Order? Or maybe there will be some internal conflict? Or maybe some external force will appear? I am completely clueless not only what could happen next but also what I would personally like.

opinion luke tlj,"So we all know by there are a lot of varied opinions on The Last Jedi. I just want to say I'm not trying to attack anyone and I won't hate you for liking or hating this movie. This is just something I've been thinking about for awhile and I wanted to get my thoughts out there. So first of all, if you haven't watched episode 4-6 for some reason or if you just don't remember Luke in those movies very well then you probably won't understand why so many people hate Lukes character in episode 8. If that's the case I recommend leaving this post and watching those movies since I don't want to spoil it for you. If it's simply been I long time since you watched the original trilogy I recommend watching these videos to refresh yourself on what looks character was like in episode 6:

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=en8bh60K7m8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=en8bh60K7m8) 

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1MnMA0TzGI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1MnMA0TzGI) 

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqaiKmm8gsY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqaiKmm8gsY) 

Now compare the Luke in those videos to this Luke:

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQPXS2BhX9g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQPXS2BhX9g) 

So this is probably my least favorite thing about Luke in The Last Jedi. Sure, he says that it was a moment of pure instinct and he wasn't actually going to go through with it but after Luke refused to fight DARTH VADER who killed MILLIONS it seems ridiculous to me he would even consider doing this. However, while I don't like this scene or the idea Luke would do that, I don't hate how Luke is portrayed in ALL of the movie. So throughout the movie we learn that Luke has basically given up on the jedi. The reason why is because after Ben went on a rampage and killed everyone else at the temple, Luke felt that he failed as a teacher and the sith simply came back even after everything he did to stop it and honestly I feel like this part of his character makes sense. If he wasn't super depressed after one of his students killed all the other students and went on to join the dark side I'd find that more weird. I honestly wish Kylo Ren became evil for a different reason because while I don't see Luke as someone who would consider killing his student like that I can find it completely understandable that he would feel like a failure after what happened as a result. 

Towards the end of the movie we get this scene between Luke and Yoda:

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZRCIjMWRLg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZRCIjMWRLg) 

I see this as the moment when Luke became the Luke we see in episode 6 again. This whole time he felt like a failure for what happened in the past but Yoda reminded him that there is still good he can do here and now. This leads us to the end of the movie, Lukes death. Luke uses the force to serve as a distraction and save the resistance by sacrificing his own life. So I have mixed feelings about how his death was handles. First of all I love the fact that he fades away looking at the two suns. I do wish however that he could have gone out as a bit more than just a distraction, even if it was to save the whole resistance. Luke was using the last of his power to make a force projection from far away which caused him to die. I would have liked it a bit more if he took out a few of the walkers with the force too. Force pushing entire walkers from another planet would be a pretty cool way to go out but honestly I don't completely hate what we got.

So that's pretty much my whole opinion of Luke in The Last Jedi.",StarWars,1567464056,DareStep,42,10,True,2019-09-02

star wars experiment watching movies first time,"As a person born in the eighties I lived my childhood surrounded by Star Wars material but never actually seen any of the movies. I thought it would be cool to watch everything, take down some notes from the experience and share it somewhere, perhaps in a place like this, just for the sake of sharing the perspective of someone who didn't need to wait long times between the movies. I hope some of you will find this entertaining. I have to warn you though, that English is not my native language, so there might be some mistakes, but I did my best to use proper English.

&amp;#x200B;

I will start with a brief disclaimer regarding the spoilers. Obviously being born in the eighties and attending primary school in the time when the movies were re-released and Star Wars becoming part of pop culture and being refrenced in so many places obviously exposed me for some spoilers, so I will list everything that I knew before I started watching the movies. Feel free to skip this part and jump straight to the list of the movies if you wish. So I knew that: Darth Vader is Lukes father, Luke and Leia are brother and sister, there are good guys and bad guys lead by Emperor, there is Yoda and Han Solo, there are light sabers and some epic space battles, there are some huge walking machines on a planet full of snow in one of the episodes, that episodes I-III are prequels to IV-VI and that the protagonist will later become Darth Vader, that there are various types of space ships native to each side of the conflict, and I knew about the Death Star and that it is blown up at some point. And I guess that would be it.

&amp;#x200B;

EPISODE IV

&amp;#x200B;

This one felt truly magical to me. I didn't expect such unique atmosphere. The high-tech sci-fi setting + magic (the Force) was really surprising blend. One of the most memorable and powerful scenes from all of the movies is when Obi Wan Kenobi tells a Storm Trooper in a vehicle to ignore them. I guess that following movies with their more and more complicated plots and bling blings kind of lack the simplicity of this one - this is basically sorcerers in robes wandering in space! Number one in terms of atmosphere.

&amp;#x200B;

EPISODE V

&amp;#x200B;

This is where things get bigger. We learn more about the world and more characters are introduced. This might be my favourite of them all. I really loved the big machines walking on the snow and the cloud city. I wonder how impactful was the Darth Vader VS Luke Skywalker scene for someone who was not spoiled about this. One one hand it is a bit cliche, but at the same time might come as a surprise. What was reaction to this scene when the movies were originally screened? Also, quite funny, when thinking about the movie retroactively some time later, it occured to me that there was no Death Star in it - it seemed so full of various elements! I guess some elements, especially from this trilogy, kind of blended to me and I am not sure which was in which movie.

&amp;#x200B;

EPISODE VI

While I still liked this movie, it was not as impactful as the previous two. I was a bit confused by the plot at some point, but maybe it is my fault. But the showdown between Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker and Emperor is another of my favourites from all of the movies! The celebratory ending itself seemed quite bland to me.

&amp;#x200B;

EPISODE I

&amp;#x200B;

I've heard that this part is quite bad but I really liked it! It was a bit different story, but had truly enjoyable plot, some memorable scenes (the pod racing!) and my favourite fight of them all - the one between Obi Wan and Qui Gonn Jinn and Darth Maul. I was quite surprised that Darth Maul was taken down so early in the game, he had really great design! Also my favourite piece of music from the movies is here - you can hear it during the fight and when some characters are climbing the building. The computer effects don't look that good now though, episodes IV-VI look much better. Initially I was not sure what was the deal with the political plot, but from perspective of seing all the movies I like that it was economical threat and not simply armed threat. Anyway, this episode is completely different than all the others and I really liked it.

&amp;#x200B;

EPISODE II

I got II and III a bit mixed. Not sure if the Palpatine in the senate scene was in this one or the other one, but it was another of my favourites, and so was when Anakin gets enraged and goes berserk to kill some guys off screen. I was not that excited by many of the fight scenes though and when they were fighting on the arena I was quite bored by the action sequences, but I really liked how this movie (or actually all prequel trilogy) make the world even bigger. I would say that prequel trilogy it so original trilogy what episode V is to episode IV - they both take cool, well established world and make it even bigger. Had mixed feeling about the new bounty hunter, because what was cool about the one from the original trilogy is that he seemed a bit mysterious, and now some of that mystery is revealed, but still it was cool to see more of his kind here. Also I was a bit disappointed with the new big bad - after very cool Darth Maul design both Count Dooku in episode II and Grievious in episodes III seemed quite bland.

&amp;#x200B;

EPISODE III

This one is all about how the things tie neatly together! I loved how the prequel trilogy made Emperor character so much better, giving him really great backstory. Most memorable scenes here would be the creation of Darth Vader and tragic recolution of Anakin's and Obi Wan's plotline. One one hand this seems like the best of the prequel movies, but for some reason episode I would have bigger rewatch value for me, although I love how the prequel story concluded here.

&amp;#x200B;

EPISODE VII

I am polarised about this one! When I was watching it, everything seemed great! It felt like watching the original movies but with modern effects and remixed plot. Very similar story, very similar characters too (Rey = Luke, Poe = Han Solo). This seemed very much like a fan service movie and at this point I was alredy very much hooked, so I welcomed those creative decisions very eagerly (also: so many connections with earlier movies). But now I wonder if it wouldn't be cooler to try different direction - that would be a bit risky too, so I guess they took a safe bet and created beautiful homage to the originals, even if it lacks uniqueness of earlier movies. Two things that I disliked? The final battle between Kylo Ren and Rey (the fight was too easy and cliche). And that it seemed like a movie to introduce multiple characters just for the sake of introducing them (maybe creating toys was the reason or giving writers of further episodes some fundaments to build on). Phasma, Hux, Finn, Poe, Snoke and perhaps some didn't seem to have much screen time and I felt like there is no real plan what happens with those characters next. And also there was pointless killing of some of the characters - talking about you, Han Solo. I can understand lack of Luke Skywalker till the last scene being a buildup to something big in the next movies, but removing Han Sole such early in the second trilogy was a mistake IMO. On the other hand, I liked that so many elements from previous movies returned and also Starkiller base was surprisingly exciting for something that is basically Death Star rehashed for the third time. I loved that actual forest grew on it. The fascist-like scene with Hux talking to the soldiers seemed impressive too, but overall I am not sure about the idea of The First Order. It seems a bit too similar to the Empire and appearing too fast after it was destroyed. Wouldn't it be cooler to tell a story about remnants of the Empire surviving in various parts of the galaxy and former Emperor's subordinates fighting for control, with one of them emerging as more serious threat?

&amp;#x200B;

ROGUE ONE

That was a nice surprise! I was not expecting much from this movie, hearing it it a spin off bridging the gaps between old and new trilogy. But this has to be my favourite of the modern Star Wars movies! I loved that it was placed in perhaps the coolest timeframe of Star Wars history, had so many oldschool looking ships and buildings, and characters that seemed taken from the original trilogy - Director Krennick was perfect! Initially I was not too invested in the characters though. But I loved the plot and how it ended tragically - really something one might not suspect! The scene with the planet being destroyed from protagonist's POV and final scene with Darth Vader and the movie seemlessly transitioning into episode IV are one of the best things in this franchise. Real gem!

&amp;#x200B;

EPISODE VIII

This was unusual. The movie seemed totally different than the previous ones, taking itself less seriously (the scene with the ironing equipment seems the essence of it). I liked this apporach because it was totally different than episode VII's and instead of ""more of the same"" we got ""something different"". I understand it might be divisive though, especially after episode VII. The plot was very weird, I didn't expect it be built around single event (one ship chasing the other) with Rey's and Luke's scenes inbetween. I liked this approach though. Scenes with Luke and Yoda were something I totally didn't expect and were simply beautiful. The final scenes on the red planet covered in salt were one of the best looking in all of the movies. Also I liked how Kylo Ren's character turned out - I was afraid we would get dark one-dimensional villian, but instead we have emotionally unstable, maybe-not-so-bad guy with access to huge power - very dangerous combination and fresh take after all those bad guys being serious all the time. It's like they wanted to say ""we are not even trying to create another Darth Vader because he is too iconic, so we are playing with Darth Vader theme by creating a character who wants to be like him but can not achieve that"". Basically, whoever was tasked with creating the new Darth Vader probably felt what Kylo Ren did. :D One of the biggest surprises was killing off Snoke - it seemed like he was being built to be the main bad guy and we didn't hear his backstory yet, so killing him was really unexpected, perhaps it was one of the most unexpected things that happened in all of the movies. I really liked it and how it changed the dynamic of the whole story. I was a bit disappointed with Phasma's demise though - she didn't do much in any of the movies and killing her didn't change much. She just looked cool. Luke's Skywalker's disappearance was kind of poetic and I really liked it. It's a shem thought that the three characters from the original movies didn't share any scene. Biggest flaw of the movie was how the chase plot was resolved - if I understand correctly, one of the ships started going very fast, to hyperspace, and destroyed the other, right? So why this couldn't be done in any of the earlier movies? This is really huge precedence and makes one ask why didn't they do something like that before and why any object could be a threat now if they can do the same again. Visually it was really cool, but plot-wise not really. Anyway, overall I liked this episode very much!

&amp;#x200B;

HAN SOLO

This was fun! Dynamic, fun action movie in space. Some of the nices action sequences of them all (the train), quite cool characters (all of the thieves) and very surprising scene with Darth Maul (I am not even asking how this is possible). Also the Imperial March is now an in-universe music. But what I really hated is how Han Solo was given his name by some random guy and also I was epecting his first meeting with Chewbacca to be a bit different, but overall this was really fun stand-alone story with potential for a sequel.

&amp;#x200B;

EPISODE IX

Obviously I haven't seen this one because it was not out yet. I honestly don't know what to expect. It seems like VII and VIII both took very different approach. Will IX be once again entirely different? I don't even know what I would like to see in that movie. VII and VIII kind of closed some of the possibilities. Good guys simply destroying The First Order would be too cliche. Maybe Kylo Ren will change his ways and by extensions will try to reform The First Order? Or maybe there will be some internal conflict? Or maybe some external force will appear? I am completely clueless not only what could happen next but also what I would personally like.

fan enjoy last jedi drunkenly tries find positives movie,"Saw TLJ once in theatres and was disappointed. Currently I am drinking and watching Netflix.  These are my random, positive thoughts let’s goooooooooooooo

-Dreadnaught general is awesome. 
-Star Wars has always shown droids riding with single pilots in small ships, but I have never understood their purpose. Seeing BB8 make mechanical fixes mid-battle is really cool. 
-This movie is visually stunning. 
-Orange is my favorite color so Poe Dameron’s ship may be the coolest space shit ever. 
-Finn’s introductory scene make him look like Buzz Lightyear, and Buzz Lightyear is awesome
-The music in Rey and Luke’s introductory scene is incredible. It is a mix of both discovery, legend, and fear. 
-I hate porgs, but they do have cute duck feet. 
-Chewie breaking down shit is great. 
-Andy Circus is a gift. 
-I completely forgot that Snoke referenced the fact that Kyle Ren was beat by a girl that had never held a lightsaber. Points back to TLJ. 
-Green titty milk hahaha
-That big ass fish would make some bomb ass sushi. 
-While I still do not particularly like how this story unfolds, I have to say the cinematic unveiling of how the dark side tempts Rey is unlike anything we have seen before and most importantly, TEMPTING. 
-BB8 moving at full speed is adorable. 
-NO THE BLACK AND ORANGE X-WING RIP emotional feels. 
-Kyle being able to kill Han when he’s face to face with him, but not being able to kill Leia when he feeling her through the force is thematically really interesting. 
-I hate the Leia god power scene, but I did not notice that Poe, Finn, and Carrie Fisher’s actual daughter are the characters that witness the act. That is a really cool touch that I did not notice before. 
-Luke in the cockpit of the Falcon. 
-Luke saying “R2?”
“The chain of command is clear, our new leader is a character we have never met before .” I’m sorry this is positive this positive. The positive thought is an actress with the caliber of Laura Dern is awesome to have the Star Wars films.
-For the most part the comedy in this movie does not work for me, but Finn’s use of “may the force be with you” is undeniably hilarious. 
-One is the best things the sequel trilogy has brought to the Star Wars movie universe is the sound design when the force is being used. Sounds makes you feel like something indescribable is happening. 
-Do you think Luke ever hit on the caretakers before? Dumb question idfk
-Mmmmmmm doritos. 
-The dark side tempting Rey with rocks and water. 
-Camp Bite reminds me of that time I went to Vegas and spent to much money at the strip club, but that is not important. What is important is that my drink is empty. 
-Watching Rey dick around with a lightsaber really makes me want to go to Disney World spend way too much money to build my own. 
-Benicio del Toro’s character sucks in this movie.  I’m sorry this is positive this positive. The positive thought is an actor with the caliber of Benicio del Toro is awesome to have the Star Wars films.
-Hahaha BB8 blowing out smoking gun is great. 
-The big eared horses just ran up a 90 degree wall. 
-You knew this was coming, shirtless Adam Driver. 
-One of my fundamental problems with the movie is the Luke and Kyle backstory, but seeing the green lightsaber again makes me happy for some reason. 
-I cannot get over how awesome Rey being tempted by the dark side is. This scene is “dark” but it does not feel dangerous, evil, or overwhelming. 
-The shot of Rey and Kyle’s ultra close up and defined fingers tips with Star Wars music is beautiful. 
-YODA!
-Hearing about failure reminds me I have work tomorrow and it is currently 12:50 am. 
-“Live free don’t join” is a new and interesting attitude that I forgot about. 
-Rey hides the books in the Falcon before she goes to find Kyle, that’s awesome. 
-Hahaha trash can BB8. 
-That gold robe is super baller.
-Not a positive or negative comment, but when did BDT’s character have time to make a deal with The First Order?
-I said it once, I’ll say it again. Andy Circus is a gift. 
-In universe I don’t like it, but as a fan Rebels is so much cooler than the Resistance. 
-“Fire at will.”
-I’m too lazy to reread what I typed, but that gold robe is unreal. 
-Kyle’s no scope lightsaber snipe was sick. 
-I could use some drinking money. 
-People either talk a lot about how cool Aldo’s suicide mission looks or the specifics of the act, but to me the best part is how the sound completely cuts out in the vacuum of space.
-Mmmmmmm I wish I had a crunch wrap supreme
-Luke Skywalker walking out to face the Empire by himself, legend. 
-The shoulder brush. 
-I’m sure things are happening that I like, but I already took my contacts out. 
-I’m not a fan of the fact that Luke is not actually there, but it’s great to see Luke in his third on screen lightsaber battle. 
-The lightsaber battle is very similar to the original Obi Wan and Vader lightsaber battle, where Vader wins physically but Obi Wan wins mentally. In TLJ Kyle wins sort of physically but Luke wins mentally. 
-Ok it’s over. Shit it’s 2 am.

star wars legacy comics many elements seem relate recent movies upcoming movie,"Here's is a few relevant pieces;

- Raised as a Jedi until the age of fourteen, Cade saw his father killed by the Sith, and the Jedi Academy.

I feel like this is similar to Kylo Rens story, instead being the one who destroyed the academy (as the legacy academy on issues is also destroyed)

- Cade was also a direct descendant of Luke and Anakin Skywalker and a descendant of Ben Skywalker

And

- In the alternate Star Wars expanded universe of novels and comic books, Han and Leia have three children: Jaina, Jacen and Anakin Solo

While we havent got these characters, we do have a Ben solo (a solo and a Skywalker), in the comics there was 2 Solo twins, Jacen and Jaina (im starting to believe Rey is basically Jaina to Kylos Jacen)

- After his mother left him as a baby, Cade was raised as a Jedi by his father on Ossus

Sounds like a mixture of Rey and Kylos stories.

- Krayt acknowledged that Cade had more power than he had ever seen in any Jedi, and offered him to join him and the Sith. Refusing his offer, Cade was forced to watch his friends die when Darth Maladiplanted Yuuzhan Vong Yorik-Kul coral seeds. Cade had no option but to help both of his friends by using his anger to cure them at a great cost. With the dark side corrupting him, Cade was surprised that Krayt showed him his father's lightsaber and revealed his former identity as Jedi Master A'Sharad Hett. Skywalker was able to escape when he injured Nihl and Talon.

Here it explains how he basically joined the sith for a brief time in order to train but mostly to fool then into being able to easily leave. This is what I'm thinking will be the case for Rey in Rise of Skywalker.

So yeah, maybe it's just me who sees major similarities, but I feel like since the movies seem to have taken some form of influence from Legacy, I feel like I can predict what is going to happen in the new movie.",StarWars,1567495047,Stillwindows95,2,3,True,2019-09-03

anakin cloned padme clone named rey theory conclude franchise,"first I'll give you some background info to state my case in the end.  

So I was on yt rewatching some bits of the prequels when/ why Anakin was turning to the dark side. 

I came to the conclusion that his turning to the ds is 2 part. 

1: turning to the darkside because of his fear of losing Padme. and Palpatine offered him a path to unlock force powers able to safe padme when needed.  

2: He was so angry with the jedi regime for not naming him jedi master. And he saw that the way of the jedi was failing the normal people.  

So while he was proving his loyalty toward palpatine by raging on the jedi order, his sole goal was being able to safe padme life in the future.

As the story went, Anakin/ DV wasn't yet able to safe padmes life. when he found out that she had died he felt betrayed by palpatine. and decided not to rest until he could bring back padme. 

!( before padme died, she stated that there is still good in him...)!  

when he encounterd and fought obi wan, his hate towards obi wan came from DV's view that obi wan was the personification of the jedi order he hated and was rejected by. not only because he was dark side.  

when Luke mentioned the name anakin to DV he became mad with Luke because it reminded him to his light side and his goal to bring back Padme. this could betray him to palpatine(P can read DV's mind) because he was hiding his masterplan for palpatine.  

now, on to the rey part...  

I believe she is cloned by darth vader/ anakin to bring back padme as he couldn't live without her.  

behind Palpatine's back he tried to clone padme with some dna he could retrieve from her.  

he didn't succeed for a long time until he discovered that he could imbue the lifeless clone with his force abilities and bring life to the clone. 

When Anakin eventually died, the clone/ rey was not yet taken outside the cloning device and the clone was left for a long time in vader's secret cloning facility. probably the clone wasn't able to grow either because there was no one to follow up the progress. Until some scavenger couple found this facility and took the girl outside the device. they raised her for some time until they discovered they were being hunted down by people affiliated with snoke or palpatine. ( during the years that went on, palpatine/ snoke had discovered anakins plan and became scared for his possible downfall in the future.)  

rey's parents left her on jakku because that will be the last place anyone would have a look for her.(pretty much nowhere) and they had hoped she could have an easy and quiet life on that planet, far away of all the trouble across the galaxy.  

this theory could explain:  

\\- why kylo ren has a connection with rey ( partially same dna)  

\\-lightsaber reacts to rey (force abilities from anakin)  

\\-when kylo ren interrogates rey he sees an island and ocean. it's the ocean that padme swam in and the island she swam to.  

\\-she didn't get her parents revealed during the mirror scene because she's a clone.  

\\-she's so strong with the force because it are anakin's force abilites getting unlocked(the force awakans) within rey. (stronger than she knows...)  

\\-she knows her parents are not her real parents...  

This theory will still maintain darth vader/ anakin an ultimate badass because of his horrible actions on innocent people.  

but, his unconditional love for his family (padme, luke and leia) will make him the ultimate familyman because he went to almost infinite lengths to protect them and try to bring them back together. (so he could rule the galaxy with his family)  

Also he will get his revenge on Palpatine as anakin was betrayed by him for not saving padme in the first place. He/ his force powers will have a 2nd change to defeat palpatine once and for all. 

and if palpatine is defeated, a new order will rise. SKYWALKER, an order that is there to serve the people. not light not dark. somewhat... gREY.

force awakens last jedi meta narrative existence,"It's not uncommon amidst discussion of Disney's latest main saga Star Wars films to find people talking about the meaning behind certain dialogue and story choices being deliberately meta, as in, the writers speaking to the audience rather than just the characters speaking to each other. Which has lead to a lot of people trying to figure out what it means. And to be clear, this is a great thing. Honestly, anything that gets people discussing about a movie on this level is a good one.

Where I think many get it wrong is assuming that by an element being meta, it is the writer, director, or studio telling the audience what to think. The most infamous example of this I see is people assuming Kylo Ren's iconic ""let the past die"" line in The Last Jedi is director Rian Johnson speaking directly to the audience about his goals with the film. And while you can't truly say whether or not this interpretation is correct unless Rian Johnson came out and said that's what he was doing, I do believe with what we're given, there's plenty of evidence to the contrary. Nothing either The Force Awakens or The Last Jedi says is meant as a sleight to the original 6 movies or anyone who dares like them.

Instead, these movies are trying to tell a story about, as weird as it sounds, their own inception. About the many types of Star Wars fans, the ups and downs the franchise has been through, and how these new films are honestly trying their best to make themselves as good as possible. Now, many would interpret this as Disney cynically trying to tell the audience to enjoy their products more than the flawed aspects of the prequels, and to be frank, I can't necessarily disagree. However, the directors of this trilogy, JJ Abrams and Rian Johnson, are both known fans of Star Wars. And I believe that whether or not Disney wanted this theme for the new movies, Abrams and Johnson transformed such a cynical idea into something passionate.

With that in mind, let's talk about the situation The Force Awakens was left in.

&amp;nbsp;

---

####The Force Awakens is both literally and thematically the return of Star Wars

It's no secret that the prequel trilogy wasn't received well. Now, don't take this the wrong way. I am not trying to say there's a right way to feel about the prequels. Just that the general consensus for a good decade was that they were not very good. That consensus has changed with time, and I don't want to give you the impression that that's anything other than a good thing. As flawed as I think the prequels are, people learning to appreciate Lucas' passion is something to be celebrated. Unfortunately, at the time The Force Awakens was in development, this wasn't the case yet. Disney clearly wanted Episode 7 to not feel distinctly *not* like the prequels, and more like the original three movies. 

And rather than push back against it, director JJ Abrams instead decided to take that in stride, and decided to make it a movie that told new fans all about why Star Wars is great and attempted to teach older fans disappointed by the prequels that they can still rekindle that love.

And if that doesn't sound like what happened, well, the movie is literally about a girl who grew up surrounded by the equivalent of Star Wars merchandise (ruins of a battle against the Empire), literally owning makeshift Rebel toys, and wearing a pilot's helmet like a toy. But she never had the joy of experiencing it for herself. And on the opposite side of the fence the *villain* of the movie is a character who is the child of two original trilogy legends, joins up with the people who are literally just trying to be the new Empire, and takes all of his inspiration from his grandfather, the main antagonist of the original trilogy.

And while all of that can lead you to interpret that the movie is trying to say that liking the new movies is good and liking the old movies is bad, that's not the case. Kylo's problem isn't that he's so attached to the original trilogy, if that were the case then Han Solo's role in this movie would make literally no sense. Kylo's problem is that he's so blinded by his nostalgia of what came before that he can't open himself up to new possibilities. And more than that, he looked at the original story of Vader and gained *nothing*. But more on that part when we get to The Last Jedi.

There's a great video by the channel Movies with Mikey about The Force Awakens called, well, [The Force Awakens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVZGUV77aRg). If you haven't seen it yet, stop reading this and go watch it first because it's a fantastic video about the significance that The Force Awakens represents and the great ideas it presented. But most importantly of all, he points out something I hadn't considered until I saw the video: The idea that the Force, more specifically the light side of the Force, represents love in the movie. And the reason that it needs to be awakened is because the movie is so devoid of love (at least in a romantic sense).

However, I don't think the story ends there. We can take that idea of love further. And while I believe Movies with Mikey was already aware of this since he himself alludes to it, I think the lack of love here, even if it's represented by a lack of romantic love, is really that no one loves Star Wars anymore. Not in the way they used to, at least. The galaxy literally represents the state of the Star Wars fandom. And wouldn't you know it, the villain of the story is a man who can't love anything about Star Wars other than what he grew up with. If this movie is about rekindling our love of Star Wars through new stories, then Kylo is the antithesis of everything this movie is trying to say. And *that* is why he's such an effective villain in this movie.

Rey's arc in this movie is an interesting one, it echoes Luke's in A New Hope, but with this added thematic context, it takes on a whole new meaning. Her hesitance to accept the Force, to go back to Jakku and wait for her parents, really represents her desire to stay with the familiar and not enter the crazy world that is Star Wars. Because Rey doesn't feel like a Star Wars fan. All she knows is the stories she grew up, but she didn't live through any of it. So ultimately, the only way she can win this fight is, I kid you not, to accept that she loves Star Wars as much as anyone else. Because the Force *is* a love of Star Wars. And that's why she keeps being told to trust in it.

And this is what I think people don't really get when it comes to Rey and Kylo's final battle. Despite the complaints that he gets defeated by Rey, Kylo is *winning* for most of this fight. It's not until the climactic moment, in which Kylo reminds her of the Force, that she finally decides to accept that she is quite literally an in-universe Star Wars fan, and suddenly, the fight turns in her favor. She wins literally because she loves Star Wars enough. 

Maybe you could interpret this as LucasFilm trying to turn Kylo into a stereotype of a toxic fan and having Rey be their surrogate to beat on him (you know, the whole ""true fan"" narrative), but I don't think that's the case. In reality, it's a counterargument against that. Kylo is the one who tries to tell her he can teach her about the Force. He's basically flexing his superiority here, trying to say he loves Star Wars more than her. Her defeating him isn't saying that she's a better fan than him, but that it doesn't matter. Anyone loves Star Wars *is* a fan. So, at least for Rey, it's not a fight over who's the bigger fan here. It's just about who is willing to open themselves up to new possibilities.

The Force Awakens is a film I gain more appreciation for the more I think about it. I used to despise it for its plot being so similar to A New Hope, but in reality, that's kind of the point. This new generation of heroes, this new generation of Star Wars fans, are just as much of fans as the people who saw the original in theaters, and are just as capable of doing the same things. And on top of that, it tells a surprisingly good story about Star Wars fandom without feeling too judge-y. In reality, it's teaching *us* not to judge.

But, as great as all of that is, it is a bit of shame that they kind of had to act like the prequels were just a mistake to be forgotten, as that kind of undermines the movie's own theme about there being no ""true"" fans. If only we had a new movie that was a love letter to all the films before it, that built upon the themes the Force Awakens set up but was even more inclusive.

Wait a minute...

####The Last Jedi is a celebration of the entire saga (yes, really)

That might seem like a weird statement to make. After all, The Last Jedi is the film obsessed with deconstructing Star Wars, that turned Luke into a grumpy old hermit who gave up on his friends and family, and even contains the line ""let the past die"" at two key moments. But appearances can be deceiving, and if we take what we see at face value, it can lead us to a very different movie than what it's actually trying to tell us. And wouldn't you know it, that's the actual moral of this movie.

The Last Jedi's theme is often stated to be learning from failure. And while that's true, I don't think that's the whole scope of it. Running with the idea that both it and The Force Awakens are meta-narrative about Star Wars, I think the theme could more accurately be described as something along the lines of ""If we take the stories we grew up with completely literally rather than learning what they were actually trying to teach us about ourselves, then we're fated to repeat the mistakes of the past."" 

Yeah, it's not exactly as catchy as ""learning from failure"", but it's more accurate to what the movie's actually trying to say. Rather than try to ignore the prequels, this movie's message is trying to teach us that we can learn from the prequels, too. And trust me, in many ways, this movie did learn from the prequels. It's very silly and goofy to the point where my mind flashed back to the prequels. And while I disliked that part of the movie at first, now I find it kind of endearing.

While The Force Awakens' meta themes about the Star Wars fandom was mainly just about Rey, Kylo, and Han (though I didn't mention him, I think his role as the literal guide to the Star Wars universe speaks for itself), The Last Jedi makes its meta theme basically the whole movie and has it coursing through the veins of every character's arc. Don't believe me? Well, let's run through them all.

&amp;nbsp;

##Poe:

Poe Dameron is a bit interesting in that he didn't really have a character before this movie. He was originally intended to be more of a hotshot pilot in the vein of Han Solo but by the final cut that was mostly absent outside of the opening. Rian likely had this arc in mind before that was cut, and he *really* runs with it here. As is the theme of this movie, Poe learns the wrong lessons from the stories he grew up with. In this case, even though they don't say it, clearly Han Solo, the rebel hero hotshot pilot who could take on the whole Empire from his ship thanks to his expert piloting skills.

Poe is certainly a gifted pilot in the same vein, and he lets that get to his head in the opening battle of the movie. Fitting himself into the role of Han Solo, relying on himself at the expense of others, gets a lot of people killed. Sure, he took down the Dreadnought, but at what cost? Poe ultimately must learn the thing that actually mattered about Han. Sure he was selfish and arrogant, but at the end of the day he was still a hero. He still went back and helped save the day in A New Hope. He was still willing to put his own selfishness aside to protect his friends. And that's the lesson Poe needs to learn to become a true leader. He needs to be less concerned with being perceived as a hero and more focused on doing what's truly right. And the character to drive him to that realization is everyone's second-favorite new character (right?), Admiral Holdo. 

Holdo doesn't tell Poe the plan because Poe is reckless and would probably use that knowledge to unintentionally put the Resistance in danger. Which, by the way, he does. It's him telling Finn and Rose that alerts DJ to the plan which allows the First Order to fire on the transports. Anyways, Holdo doesn't really care what Poe thinks of her because she knows she's saving as many lives as possible by *not* telling him. I mean, Leia even tells him as much when she explains to Poe what happened by telling him that Holdo was more concerned with saving the Resistance than ""seeming like a hero"". So, through Holdo's lesson, Poe learns the true heroism of Han Solo isn't just ""jumping into an X-wing and blowing stuff up"", it's protecting his friends and allies. And sure enough, it's him who leads the Resistance to safety on Crait.

&amp;nbsp;

##Finn:

Finn is not as easy to slot into this theme at first. He's often criticized as being worthless to this film, treated as nothing more than a joke, or in some cases, a ""racist stereotype"" (do I really need to explain how much of a stretch that is?). In reality, Finn's arc is actually one of the most interesting in the movie. It has nothing to do with the *plot*, but it has everything to do with the *story*. He's unique to the other characters in that he doesn't care about the stories of the Rebels or the Empire. He just wants to get himself and Rey away from the First Order. Often criticized as repeating his arc, this is really just a continuation of what he learned in The Force Awakens. In that movie he learned to join the fight at all, but that was done in the context of protecting Rey. He saves her at the end, so in reality, the natural course for him is to make sure when Rey returns from Ahch-To, she's safe.

But Finn's arc in this movie is to start caring about the story of Star Wars, because ultimately Johnson is not trying to tell us that those stories are bad, it's that they can teach us something. And Finn doesn't care enough to learn. He's only self-interested right now. This is why Canto Bight, the epitome of greed and ego, is so appealing to Finn. And why everyone's favorite new character (right???) Rose is here to teach him to actually start caring for once. This is why Finn's antagonist in this movie is not Captain Phasma or anyone who would further his storyline about being a former Stormtrooper, but DJ.

DJ also represents the story of Han Solo here, but here, what Finn takes from the story of Han Solo is that there *is* something appealing to Han *before* he joined the Rebellion, to not caring about the fight at all. This is where I think Rian Johnson saying that he originally had Poe joining Finn on his quest to Canto Bight but decided not to because their dialogue was interchangeable. Not because he didn't understand these characters, but because their stories are both centered around teaching them something about the same character, and it was likely difficult to create the distinction in what they believed about him.

Anyways, DJ's betrayal teaches Finn that there isn't much that was admirable about pre-ANH Han (something Solo seems to ignore by just having him repeat his ANH arc). By not caring, he is complacent in the First Order's victory. And *this* is why he proclaims to Phasma that he's rebel scum. Because he's finally decided to join the fight against the First Order. But the movie takes an interesting turn, because they really try to get the most out of Finn's arc and don't just let it end there.

Since Finn and Poe's arcs are both about learning from Han Solo, in a stroke of genius, Finn's journey has now brought him to the same point Poe was at at the start of this movie. This is why Finn's sacrifice wouldn't have worked as the conclusion to his arc. He's only been convinced to help fight the First Order, not truly ally with the Resistance and fight to protect them. That's why when Rose tells him his sacrifice isn't worth it, Finn doesn't say he's doing this to protect her or anyone else, he says ""I won't let them win."" He's fallen into the same trap Poe did. And this is where I think the movie makes a major misstep. Poe should've been the one to save Finn here (and probably was in the aforementioned earlier draft). It makes way more sense in terms of driving this point home.

Nevertheless, Finn, too, learns from the mistakes of Han Solo, and both he and Poe have finally understood the theme of this movie. But their contribution to the themes are nothing compared to the remaining characters.

&amp;nbsp;

##Kylo Ren (and Rey, too):

This section is mainly about Kylo Ren but Rey is inevitably going to be part of this since their arcs are so interlinked they literally share a force bond for most of the movie. However, Rey is not the focus here. Kylo is.

As with The Force Awakens, Kylo represents the antithesis of the movie's theme. ""The past"" is a term used by Kylo repeatedly, and it's pretty clear to pretty much everyone that ""the past"" represents Star Wars as a whole to Kylo. In that vein, Kylo has looked at the mistakes of the past, and learned nothing, *gained* nothing. That's why he wore a Vader-like helmet despite not needing it at all. He idolized Vader but ignored the most important thing Vader ever did: Redeem himself. And when Snoke berates him that he'll never be like Vader, Kylo decides to give up idolizing the past, and instead, rather than try and fix its mistakes like he was attempting to do with his Vader persona, decides that since the past had so many mistakes, there's no saving it. It all needs to go away. To die, if you will.

Rey tries to see something better in Kylo, though. She sees the conflict in him. The potential for him to rekindle that love of Star Wars. And that's what's important to understand about Rey in this movie. The reason she doesn't seem to have an arc is because the lesson she learned in the Force Awakens is the one she needs to teach others. And to her credit, she tries to do the same even for the person she has every reason to hate. 

But despite her not seeming to have an arc, she, too, falls victim to the same trap everyone else does in this movie and thinks that because she heard the story of Vader being redeemed that the same can happen for Kylo just as easily. But she makes the critical mistake of assuming that she can do all the work for him. But Vader wasn't redeemed solely through Luke's action. He had to make the active choice to save his son. Kylo, too, has to make that choice. And unfortunately she fails to understand that Kylo is no Vader anymore. He's already made his choice.

This is why there's so many direct parallels to Return of the Jedi in the Snoke throne room scene. Not because Rian Johnson is unoriginal (and really, after everything I've discussed, I hope it's clear how untrue that is), but because he's deliberately manipulating us into believing what Rey believes. That such a similar circumstance *is* enough to turn Kylo. But, as I said when we started discussing this movie, appearances can be deceiving. It's a common motif in this movie to show us a scene we already think we know as a way of showing us every character failing to understand the message of the movie. And despite the accusations that she's a Mary Sue (a term that needs to die anyways), she failed to understand the message most of all (with one exception, who we'll get to later)

This is why the Snoke throne room scene is so effective. The fact that Return of the Jedi seems to be happening at the halfway point of the trilogy sends your mind racing the first time you watch it. Snoke's dead, Kylo's good now, where is this story about to go? Your mind is constantly fighting between the awesomeness that is the throne room fight and the flawed belief the movie has tricked you into yet again. But of course, when the fight ends, Kylo isn't redeemed. Both we and Rey are left disappointed as Kylo reveals that all he's done by killing Snoke is do exactly what he promised: To let the past die.

If The Force Awakens was a statement about the state of the fandom after the prequels, this movie *runs* with that. Going with the idea that embracing the force is embracing a love of Star Wars, Kylo's new ""let the past die"" mentality closes himself off from loving even the Star Wars he cherished back in The Force Awakens in the same way ever again. Essentially Kylo's tired of hearing about Star Wars, and being reminded of the thing he once loved being ""ruined"" in his eyes (I believe this metaphor is meant to represent the prequels but takes on an interesting new context with the backlash to TLJ) by Luke's mistake. Luke misused the Force (or in this case, the franchise) and that's what lead to the creation of Kylo and eventually to this new mindset of his. But we'll get more into that when we talk about Luke.

But obviously, things aren't that simple. Kylo hasn't *really* given up on the past, despite what he says. And this is why the idea that ""let the past die"" is Rian Johnson speaking through Kylo is absolutely untrue. Because Kylo's more stuck in the past than anyone. He just wants to stop being reminded of it. Stop being reminded he ever loved Star Wars and just let it fade from his memory. And admittedly, from that lens, his mindset doesn't seem that bad, does it? Well, this goes back to that Movies with Mikey video. To paraphrase what he said, our world is better specifically because we have Star Wars. It's a cheesy message, but he is right. This franchise has brought so much joy to so many people and metaphorically, Kylo doesn't just want to not hear about it anymore, he basically wants no one to enjoy it anymore.

And with that, I hope it becomes clear that this movie doesn't hate Star Wars or its fans. It's a celebration of being a Star Wars fan. Because the villain of this movie, the real bad guy we had to be worried about all along, is not Supreme Leader Snoke, the one who only to selectively wipe out the parts of the past that don't fit his agenda. And it's certainly not the rest of the First Order, the ones who love the past in all the wrong ways. It's Kylo Ren, the one who wants Star Wars gone entirely. And when you understand that, the only way for this movie to still be endorsing Kylo Ren is if you agree with him.

&amp;nbsp;

##Luke:

Who represents Star Wars more than Luke Skywalker? I can name maybe like one other guy and that's only because he actually appeared in both trilogies. I called this movie a celebration of Star Wars, and even when I say that Luke represents Star Wars, I stand by that claim. As we discussed with Kylo this movie is telling you being a fan is a good thing. That loving Star Wars in any form *is* good. And just because Luke has convinced himself that he's not the representation of Star Wars we all herald him as, doesn't mean that he isn't.

While Rey is very much the protagonist, this truly is Luke's movie. And while we've talked about metanarrative and how much more this movie leans into it than Force Awakens, Luke's entire arc is basically the ""Oops! All Berries"" of meta commentary. If you thought I got too artsy-fartsy with the Kylo section about how this movie is validating your love of Star Wars then you haven't seen anything yet.

The most controversial element of this movie comes with the first action Luke does. He tosses away the lightsaber that had kept us on a knife's edge for two years. Many people saw this as an insult. An insult to caring about Luke's return and the big cliffhanger they used to set it up. And Rey, our protagonist and audience surrogate is right there with you. What even happened here?

Well, believe it or not, the best way to describe what happened to Luke comes from Screen Junkies' [Honest Trailer for The Last Jedi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paxgKBUK4wQ). ""He's turned his back on the franchise after watching the prequels, and not even reruns of A New Hope can change his mind."" While it's a joke, it's the joke that started me thinking about this stuff for over a year. Because they're right, in a way. Luke's let his own mistakes prevent him from believing he can still do more good.

And to be clear, there was a mistake here. Luke demonstrably did something wrong. And the important thing that I think people don't recognize here is that *he acknowledges this*. Yes, Luke was taught that these things were wrong, but the idea that for just a second, in the heat of the moment, he couldn't forget those teachings, is unbelievable is where the idea that many critics of Luke's character just want him to be perfect comes from. Luke doesn't try to justify what he did here. He *knows* that he should know better. The fact that even for a second he almost did the most un-Jedi-like thing possible is why he cut himself off from the Force, and as we've established, they really are running with the idea of the Force as a love of Star Wars here. 

So all that disappointment you feel, about how uncharacteristic this is for Luke, he agrees with you. The idea that he was literally incapable of considering compromising his morals, even for a second, is EXACTLY what lead him to make that mistake. Because, he most of all, fell victim to the theme of this movie. He didn't believe in a story about anyone else. He believed in his own story and forgot that he made mistakes along the way to get there. He believed for a moment that because the galaxy thought everything he did was right, that their belief *made* him right. As he puts it, he believed in the legend of Luke Skywalker. But of course, no one is truly infallible. He knows this. But that brief moment where he forgot had disastrous consequences.

So then, why not try to fix his mistake? Why not try to redeem Kylo the same way he did his father? The important thing to understand here is that with Vader, he was the solution to his father's evil. With Kylo, he was the cause. As we literally see demonstrated on Crait, Luke could never be the one to redeem Kylo because Kylo would never listen to the person he hates most. So Luke's convinced himself the only thing he *can* do is end the unending cycle of the Jedi and the Sith. In other words, like many fans sadly are, he's done with Star Wars. Which, once more, was likely intended as allegory for the prequels but feels ironically more fitting with the backlash to this movie.

But of course, like Kylo, no matter how much Luke can tell himself he's done with the whole affair, he hasn't really forgotten. Why do you think he's wearing Jedi robes on a secret Jedi temple? Why do you think even in seemingly his darkest moment, when he's ready to burn down the texts of the Jedi, he can't follow through with it? He's still a better person than Kylo. He doesn't just want Star Wars to end entirely.

So then why does Yoda burn down the tree? Well, for one thing, because Rey has the Jedi texts as we see in the Falcon, so the tree was empty anyways. For another, he's trying to teach Luke a lesson. *The* lesson of the movie. ""The greatest teacher, failure is."" The most important thing we can learn from the stories of Star Wars, or *any* stories at all, is that they weren't perfect. But we can use what we learned to tell better stories ourselves. That's what directors like JJ and Rian are *trying* to do, even if they didn't succeed in the eyes of many. They want to tell the best Star Wars stories they can. And Luke, too, learns this thanks to Yoda's wisdom.

So, finally, he shows up on Crait. Not literally, but as a projection. Or, in different terms, a legend. Maybe the legend of Luke Skywalker wasn't what we believed it was, but that doesn't mean it wasn't worth believing in. Just that viewing him as an unquestionably perfect hero only served to disappoint us. And wouldn't you know it, for many, it did. However, what this movie is telling you is that it's okay to feel disappointed, but that you weren't wrong for loving Luke Skywalker. 

And ultimately, even though he doesn't actually fight Kylo, even though *no one* in the Resistance saw what he did, they know he bought them time. They know that whatever he did was to make sure hope lived on. The fact that no one sees this and the fact that he saves like 20 people is the biggest complaint I see people have. Yet it's my favorite part of the whole thing. Because it doesn't matter exactly what Luke did. Because the legend is still more valuable. And even if he only saved a handful of people, what he taught them is what will save the whole galaxy: That the legend of Luke Skywalker is worth believing in. And if you really don't think that's what they're trying to say, the movie literally ends on kids playing with toys telling THEIR version of events because eventually the story reached Canto Bight, and then we see one of the kids use the Force because he, too, has been inspired by Luke.

And that's why I don't get the criticism about the mistakes he made in this movie. Because he does make up for them in the end. He gave up on being the hero the Resistance needed, but in the end he comes to save them at their darkest hour. And sure, maybe he didn't try to redeem Kylo. He tells Leia ""I can't save him."". But there's a reason he also says ""No one's ever really gone."" Maybe Luke, the flawed individual who made this mistake, can't save Kylo. But the legend that inspired a generation can. So, maybe Luke won't directly save Kylo, but what he taught will inform the person who will (Rey). The idea that Luke was butchered by this movie, that there's no saving his character without a total retcon, is the EXACT mistake he made with Kylo that started this mess. Maybe, like Rey, there's something more important you can learn from his arc in this movie.

40 years after the release of A New Hope I find this to be the most fitting send-off for Luke specifically because our undying love for this character is what allows him to save the day. No one making this movie hated Luke Skywalker. They loved him so much that they made his arc in this movie about him realizing how crucial he is to this franchise that his sacrifice is the literal reason it continues. And in the end he finally becomes one with the Force.

Luke *is* Star Wars now. If that doesn't represent respect and adoration for his character, I don't know what does.

&amp;nbsp;

####Why Rey's parents being nobody is the most important plot point in the entire trilogy

And now we get to the real reason I made this post. You may have noticed I kind of skimmed over Rey, only really talking about her in regards to how she affects other characters. This isn't because she was inconsequential to The Last Jedi, but because what she learns in this movie is so important that I wanted to save it for its own section, even after I talked about Luke.

As we all know, late into The Last Jedi, in yet another moment deliberately meant to draw us into a false sense of nostalgia, Kylo parallels the ""I am your father"" moment from The Empire Strikes Back. But like the throne room scene prior, they're tricking you. Tricking you into believing that like Luke, Rey's parentage will somehow save the day. But of course, that's not the case. Kylo gets Rey to admit the truth: They were nobody. Kylo goes on to say they were junk traders and that they're dead, but that part doesn't matter. The script direction says Rey only *believes* that part. All we know for sure is that they weren't important. The rest doesn't matter. 

The point is that *it might as well* be the case, whether or not the exact details are true. The important thing here is that Rey's parentage isn't the answer she's been searching for this whole time. It can't solve all of her problems. It can't give her the meaning she desires. It can't make her part of Star Wars. Like Luke in The Empire Strikes Back, this moment is meant for Rey to face the hardest truth she possibly could. And all of this metanarrative, everything we've discussed, leads to the hardest thing for Rey, our surrogate fan of Star Wars, to have to face: That she has no place in Star Wars.

This is why it hurts me to see people creating conspiracy theories about how what she heard was actually only a half-truth and she's related to Darth Plagueis or something. It misses the point. If Rey's from an important lineage, if she's related to some major character, then she'll have been inserted a backstory into this universe. She, like everyone else, will become part of Star Wars by birthright. But she's not. She isn't handed a place in this story. Kylo literally tells her ""You have no place in this story."" She has to earn her place in this story. Or, more accurately, she already has.

I roll my eyes whenever I see people complaining that Rey is too powerful in the Force, when the Force has always operated on the delightfully naive idea of you being more powerful the more you believe in it. And if the Force is loving Star Wars, then Rey is so powerful because she proves that even a new fan, one who only entered this franchise with the sequels, is just as much a Star Wars fan as anyone else. And I find that relatable as I myself really only entered this fanbase with The Force Awakens. And this revelation retroactively makes that movie *even stronger*.

The idea that Rey is some flawless protagonist who has been handed her powers on a silver platter is wrong because she *earned* that power. Not through buying into the values of nerd culture like important bloodlines or rigorous training. But just by doing what everyone on this forum does: By loving Star Wars. This revelation of her parents being nobody doesn't retcon one of the biggest mysteries out of The Force Awakens or turn her into a Mary Sue, it's the natural payoff of what The Force Awakens established with her. So complain all you want about how many rocks she lifted or how she beat Kylo Ren, but at the end of the day, what does that really matter compared to what her being so powerful actually *says*?

And one more thing. I see the idea floated around that Rey's parents being nobody is all well and good but that they shouldn't have made it a mystery if the answer would be nothing. And I think that shows a fundamental misunderstanding of Rey in *both* movies. Rey's search for her parents represents her need for validation, to effectively slot herself into Star Wars (something I believe even JJ was trying to do and Rian only made more overt). If we knew her parents were nobody from the beginning, then it makes the gutpunch when Rey admits they weren't important so much less impactful. Because it *is* still a twist. Just not the twist we expected. But I think it's the one we needed.

I hope everything I discussed with this section makes it clear why Rey's parentage being unimportant means so much. All of these themes about the new fans being accepted right alongside the old ones is completely undermined by subsequently having to ""validate"" their inclusion via a prior connection to Star Wars. Neither The Force Awakens nor The Last Jedi are effective thematically once you tell us that Rey *isn't* nobody. And the idea that the revelation that Rey was a Skywalker or something would've ""fixed"" this trilogy misses the point so much that it honestly saddens me.

####The Downside

While this post has mostly been praising these two movies for what they did thematically, I think it's only fair to acknowledge the less favorable implications what they do has. While these movies were directorially driven stories by Star Wars fans, for Star Wars fans, and *about* Star Wars fans, they're not created in a bubble. And we can't pretend Disney was completely hands-off here.

Therefore, you could easily interpret all the positives I said as Disney preying on our nostalgia, validating our love for Star Wars only to encourage us to become more engrossed in Star Wars than ever before to get us to spend as much money as possible on Star Wars. And, I think the most negative thing I have to say about all of this is that I can't really disagree. Maybe these themes weren't Disney's idea, or maybe they were. Either way the only way they approved of them is likely *because* they believed it'd get more money.

And while it may be tempting to just say to ignore that, to focus on the passion of the storytellers, it's hard to completely divorce the story they've told from the business they're working for. Disney is a greedy, nigh-monopoly of a media empire. And just because they own things we like doesn't mean we shouldn't acknowledge their faults. What we got here is a best-case scenario. Either way these movies were going to be advertisements designed to sell more products. We're just lucky they told an entertaining story as well, even if that story is *still* trying to encourage us to buy more products.

Now, don't take this the wrong way. There's nothing wrong with loving Star Wars, even under Disney. I wouldn't have made this post if not. But I felt it was important to end with this disclaimer because I want people to still be aware as consumers. Star Wars is going to make bank regardless of the few people who read this post. But that's exactly my point. Disney doesn't *need* you. 

While this post is designed to encourage you to be a *fan* of Star Wars, what Disney wants from any consumer is for them to be a *slave* to Star Wars. But Disney's rich, and like I said, they don't need you. Even if you looked at my entire post and went ""that's great, and I still love Star Wars, but I still don't like the sequels and won't see episode 9"" that's *perfectly* fine. As I hope this post has made clear, there is no *right* kind of Star Wars fan. Just because these new movies are celebrating their own existence doesn't mean that you should feel forced to like them. Don't feel obligated to see a movie *just* because it's Star Wars. You'd only be falling into the exact kind of habit Disney wants.

Sorry if this ending section seems a bit preachy, but as much as I love the themes of these movies, I was worried if I just ended the post before this section that I might be giving people the wrong idea, and doing Disney's work for them. Even if this post convinces you that LucasFilm and the creative team doesn't hate Star Wars, make no mistake, *Disney* only cares about Star Wars in terms of the money it makes them. Always keep that in mind.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

It was recently pointed out to me by someone that The Last Jedi, despite the controversy and internet debate, is still in the end, a product in the eyes of Disney that will inevitably be forgotten. This wasn't said by someone who necessarily hated the movie, I'm not even sure what they think about the movie exactly, but they are still right. This is *just* a movie, one that is almost guaranteed to never be as influential as the original.

And that's a shame, but that fact doesn't make me love the movie any less. In the same vein, I don't really expect this post to get noticed. Despite me nearly reaching Reddit's character limit, nothing I say is gonna get to that many people, no matter how hard I try. But even if what I'm saying here might not matter to everyone else, or will even be remembered very long after it's submitted, it matters to me.

mandalorian boba fett theory prediction,"So I'm not sure if I'm either late to the party on this one and everyone already suspects this or nobody cares but basically without beating around the bush, this theory supports the idea that the identity behind Disney's upcoming Mandalorian character is Boba Fett.

So I heard about 'Shrodinger's Fett' where at the moment to the public, Boba Fett's character is currently dead/undead because the creators simply don't know what to do with him. 

Now with little evidence to back up my claim, we have to look at these important facts that support why Disney would make the Mandalorian's identity as Boba Fett:

. Why would Disney of all eras, pick after ep 6 to start a tv series?
. Top 3 plans for solo films/shows in order respectively were SOLO, FETT, KENOBI,
. Mandalorian character doesn't exactly align with the angle Disney is trying to push- more focussed on next gen of Jedi and force sensitives
. Mandalorian happens to be a bounty hunter and no other information about his identity is given other than the fact he is played by Pedro Pascal.


Reasons this theory is probably false is cause Pedro Pascal doesn't look like Boba Fett, at least canonically speaking and technically they could have gotten the original actor of Jango since he is around the right age to play Boba.

obi wan kenobi theory time tatooine secret behind achieving force apparition post death,"I had a thought while thinking about the new Obi-Wan Kenobi Series airing on the Disney+ Streaming Service and it grew quite large in my head and I need to share it. Keep in mind, my only source is the movie content as I have not read any or seen anything else. I know, its treason.  
\---------------

I thought during the Battle on Mustafar between Kenobi and Skywalker: Why was Obi-Wan's anger not more prominent? Then it occurred to me that Obi-Wan let Anakin burn to death. Granted Anakin lived to become a feared Sith Lord, but Kenobi did not know this, he thought he had killed his brother by letting the fires of Mustafar swallow him. It does not seem like alot but this is a very out of character move for Kenobi, a little on the dark side (excuse the pun).

With this in mind, it is a stretch but maybe Kenobi did indeed let himself faulter ever so slightly. This would be understandable given the atrocities that Anakin had performed in the last few hours, however this is not my main theory.

It came to my attention that the only Force Users that achieved Force Apparition after death in the movies were those we know most and may have had or did have a slight hand in the dark side of the force. From my understanding the Force is like Yin and Yang, there must be an equally opposite flow. I'd think that Force Apparition or ""Force Ghosting"" would be one of those high tier abilities that one might achieve when becoming one with the force and thus achieving all sides: Both the Yin and the Yang; The Dark and the Light.

My proof is lacking but here it goes:

* Qui-Gon Jinn discovered this strange ability before his untimely death and as told in Episode III had only told Yoda, a trusted mentor of his and a wise Jedi Master.
* Yoda who is very strong in the force was able to capture, contain, and repel Force Lightning (a common trope of the dark side) by Episode II and sometime later in Episode III did so again in the Battle against Palpatine and then proceeded to tell Kenobi of the ability so he may master it on Tatooine. Yoda also uses the force to manipulate lightning in Episode VIII.
* The Force Users we have seen in ""ghost form"" are Yoda, Kenobi, Anakin, and Luke. With the idea that it does take abit of both sides, these Force Users are the perfect example. Yoda being powerful and with Qui-Gon's discovery, Luke being drawn to both sides, Anakin being drawn to both sides consistently, and Obi-Wan who while quite powerful did not fit into the criteria but may have been told in a time where he felt lost.
* Force Users who stayed to close to one side had not achieved this such as anyone else on the Jedi Council, nor any Sith who came pre-Vader like Maul or Dooku.

To get down to the point, it is my theory that after falling to the anger and suffering that powers the Dark side but keeping to his Jedi Practices, Yoda saw Kenobi as ready to take on the next step, a new way of looking at the force. Kenobi will go to Tatooine and practice this blending of Dark and Light as Yoda has told him and will achieve balance. Ben Kenobi would have prepared Luke for such a perception of the Force if he had not encountered Vader, and it could be said that Luke tried to do the same with Rey by showing her the balance first.

If i have missed any good points, or if anyone has any way of blowing this up Alderaan-style, please don't hesitate to comment. I would like to see this pushed in the Kenobi Series, or in other words I would like to be right, but there is so much Star Wars content out there and there is so much lore entrusted to the best of us that I am most probably on the wrong path.

disney removed episode numbers,"This is sort of a fan theory.

So, when Disney released its official timeline of the core movies and shows they took away the episode numbers in the OT, also the sequals have been lack of as well, why? Well it is sort of obvious. Disney has talked about the next trilogy and many have speculated that is could be about the Old Republic and how it fell and the creation of the Galactic Republic. Well technicly this makes it a second prequal series and there can't be episode numbers on more prequals. Episode I is established they won't do an Episode -1, -2, or a -3. That makes no sence.

like see star wars infinities return part,"I'd like to see a scenario for each of the first 6 films. So this will be 6 part series.  
Episode 1: The duel on Naboo goes differently. Obi-Wan falls down the pit but he survives. Qui-Gon believes that Obi-Wan is dead and is forced to retreat as he can't defeat Maul. Qui-Gon takes on Anakin as his padawan.  
Obi-Wan travels to Mandalore to reunite with Satine and he chooses to marry Satine and start a family with her rather than rejoin the Jedi.  
Thanks to Qui-Gon's training, Anakin has greater control over his emotions and confides in Qui-Gon about his marriage to Padme.  
Dooku still leaves the Jedi but rather than join the Sith and the CIS he aligns himself with Mandalore and the other neutral systems. Dooku also trains Obi-Wan.  
Maul is still Sidious' apprentice and Sidious advances his dark side training so Maul learns force lightning and since Maul becomes the leader of the CIS, Sidious trains him in other areas like politics and negotiating.  
The Clone Wars still break out.  
Dooku and Obi-Wan teach the people of the neutral systems how to defend themselves from threats like Death Watch, pirates and the Hutts since they can't rely on the Jedi who are occupied fighting the Clone Wars.  
I'm not sure how the story should go from there so please give me some suggestions in the comments.  
Some ideas I do have are:  
A scenario in which Maul kills Sidious and the CIS win the war and the Jedi flee to the neutral systems where they must regain the trust of the people in order to build up an army to oppose the CIS.  
A scenario in which Sidious kills Maul and issues Order 66 but Anakin doesn't turn to the dark side and so more Jedi survive. Sidious has Satine and Dooku killed which leads to Obi-Wan turning to the dark side and becoming Darth Vader, Sidious' new apprentice.

After Luke dies palpatines spirit from Luke is set free and both halves from the mask and Luke are both together so the emperor is set free and can possess kylo or someone else..

star wars film preferred upon second viewing,"I have just watched Episode VIII for the second time (first was in the cinema when it upon release).
I have to say, watching it this time around, away from the hype and high expectations with not knowing what's going to come, I really enjoyed it.

Knowing the parts I disliked on my first viewing (Luke's weak moment and his death among some) I actually thought it was well done on the second viewing (now that I wasn't distracted with the sudden shock of it all).

I now appreciate the set pieces, the battles, the light speed attack on Snoke's ship (epic!) The throne room battle, the face off between Kylo and Force Projected Luke...

I think the one thing that comes to mind that I'm still jarred with is Leia's space flying scene. I'm still coming to terms with that... 

I think on my first viewing I was distracting myself with how this all fits in the grander Star Wars movies and I wasn't giving the film the chance it actually deserves.

As a stand alone film it's very entertaining and with some very tense moments! Yeah, it's not perfect, but it's a worthy Star Wars film that does not deserve the hate it receives...

I applaud Rian Johnson for being daring with the franchise and characters in hindsight. I felt TFA was too safe and boring in comparison.

While it makes sense that Rey wouldn’t be as well versed as the Jedi in the prequels, i feel like the cinematography has moved from intense and gritty to  more calm, with lots of wide angle shots. There’s nothing wrong with wide angle shots, but with the approach to combat in the new series, we’re getting simple choreography with shots that don’t add any intensity.

theory palpatine motivation bible connecticut,"This Sith symbol change to reflect the dark side and light side of the force kind of reflects my thinking on Palpatines motivations. I believe the ultimate goal of Palpatine, besides ruling over the physical world, was to achieve a ""balance "" in the force and mastering that as well. The galaxy (physical world). The force (spiritual world). I also believe that theres a biblical connection as well. In the Bible God creates man. Calls him Adam. God gives Adam 1 commandment. God says to Adam that he can eat freely from any tree in the Garden but the tree in the midst of the garden, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, you shall not eat. For if Adam ate from that tree he would surely die. The tree essentially contains good and evil, (life and death). When Adam was created God breathed his living holy spirit into Adam and adam became a living being. Adam did not know evil. Long story short God then created Eve , Adam's wife from Adam's rib. One day eve was confronted in a conversation with the serpent ie satan. (Genesis 3) this is what took place....""Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the LORD God had made. He said to the woman, ""Did God really say, \`You must not eat from any tree in the garden'?"" The woman said to the serpent, ""We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden,but God did say, \`You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will die.'"" ""You will not surely die,"" the serpent said to the woman. ""For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be Like God, knowing good and evil."" When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining Wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it.Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves.""   This is how mankind fell. Wanting to be Like God knowing good and evil.  Adam and eve spiritually died in that moment and their bodies began to grow old and die as well. Henceforth every person born after their fall reflects their fall...spiritually dead with withering bodies.   Back 2 star wars.... I believe Palpatine wanted to be ""like God"" mastering good and evil and ruling over creation. A clue to this is the Darth Plagueis the wise tale Palpatine told Anakin Skywalker. In the tale Darth Plagueis was a dark lord of the Sith (masters of evil, dark side). He became so wise with the force he was able to keep the ones he loved from dying. Meaning Plagueis had achieved, through wisdom of the force, the ability to master good and evil, life and death. So he was a sith who could wield the light side of the force like a Jedi.  Plagueis became ""like God"". Well the rest of the tale tells us his apprentice, most likely Palpatine, killed him in his sleep.   I believe Palpatines goal is to achieve what Plagueis achieved. Mastering the force. Becoming ""like God"". But for some reason he cant. Hes powerful with the dark side but the light side elludes him.   I also believe that Palpatine genetically created Anakin to somehow bring this about. (That's why anakin had no father)  Anakin's tendencies were towards the dark side. I believe Palpatine created anakin this way on purpose, thru midichlorians, but then had anakin be raised by Jedi in order to learn the light, good side of the force. Somehow , in some way, this would benefit Palpatine in achieving mastering the dark side and light side of the force. Balance.  To be God one must be able to be master over Good and evil, life and death.  I also believe Rey is a clone. A young Shmi Skywalker clone. Just like the Jango fett clones I believe the Shmi Skywalker clones have a purpose. This was kind of revealed in the last jedi when Rey was in a cave and the force revealed multiples of herself. I also believe Rey or another Shmi clone is a plan B. Palpatines original plan was through Anakin but Luke saved him spiritually. (Book of Luke, Jesus, salvation, redemption)  anyway just my thoughts. Probably over thinking this. Back 2 eating cookies in bed.   (P.S.  I dont believe,  as some do, that Luke brought balance to the force. Luke did not turn to the dark side. He didn't wield both. Luke righted a wrong. Which is good but isn't the same as mastering dark side, light side.)  If I'm wrong , I'm wrong. Just a thought.",StarWars,1567562201,Vanlightning44,0,1,True,2019-09-03

I would liken this scenario to the New Republic's Modernization program, which had Nebula-class Star Destroyers and Endurance-class fleet carriers sharing a hull design.

anakin versus obi wan fight scene bad good,"I don't mean this to be a troll post in anyway, although I think I'm going to get biased opinions here.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, a precursor: Several separate friend groups have been watching the prequels recently, I've never been much of a Star Wars buff myself, but I've seen them. Anyways, I got some mixed reactions and opinions as to whether the movies were good or not, mostly citing that the movies don't hold up to today. I wanted to test this but don't have 7 and a half hours to spend. So I decided to check out one of what I remember being one of the best parts of the trilogy. Anakin's duel with Obi-Wan on Mustafar.

&amp;#x200B;

In the end... I felt disappointed. One of the comments my friends made was about all the spinning in the duel, and I have to agree. It feels like they added it in just to make it seem complex, and it looks that way with the lightsaber swinging around. But watching their bodies it all looks sort of ridiculous with them swinging them around like batons. It's especially bad when they turn in place, going from a typical knees bent battle stance to just spinning around in a full circle, not especially quick or anything. Obi-Wan does this early in the duel as he's backed up into a corner and then steps to the side, which could be argued that that was the plan, but then why not sidestep Anakin? It feels like a lot of superfluous movement, again to trick the viewer into complex choreography. One particularly egregious moment is when Anakin and Obi-Wan just swing their lightsabers around each other for about two to three seconds before meeting in a clash. But without the idea of weight behind the blades, the impact is lackluster, and thus the swinging feels childish. Maybe this could all be waved away with the fact that lightsabers have no weight, thus the ideal way to use them is to fling them around... but in the end, when I looked at the duel I expected to see two battle-experienced warrior monks duke it out in a display of skill and technique, but Anakin and Obi-Wan weren't able to convince me of that, unlike some of the fights I'd seen in Genndy Tartakovsky's Clone Wars, which felt more calculated and thought-out.

&amp;#x200B;

Aside from that, I noticed some weird shots in the scene. At one point when Anakin is first choking Obi-Wan out his eyes are looking in two separate directions. I don't mean to insult the actor if he has a condition, but I'm certain he's been able to keep his eyes straight before... my question ends up being, why keep this shot? Why not reshoot that one bit? Keeping it in makes for a goofy shot in what is otherwise supposed to be a serious scene. Another moment was when they take cover from the lava it suddenly jumps to what looks like stock footage of volcanoes erupting. It looks sort of like Mustafar, but was jarring enough for me to notice.

&amp;#x200B;

I also noticed moments where I could tell the fight was choreographed. One moment of this that especially stands out is when they go out into the hallway outside of the control room. The first few hits, I feel like I get a hint of this but it's when the camera switches to show Anakin's back and he does this awkward move where he bends the saber towards Obi-Wan he holds it there, and then Obi-Wan meets him. I've heard an argument that they've known each other so well that they anticipate each others' moves combined with the precognitive powers of the Jedi. However, I don't recall the films facilitating this. I know it can be implied, but I feel like a precedent could have been set with a scene in II or III with the two sparring against each other. It's a miss-out on foreshadowing and development.

&amp;#x200B;

As for the CG, I've heard people complain about that as well, but the only really horrible bit of that I saw was when the CG lava splashed up onto the catwalk. Maybe I don't have an eye for that.

&amp;#x200B;

As for the dialogue, it's corny, but I do give it a pass due to it being the final dramatic moment between these two. I will point to the meme, ""High ground!"" as being particularly silly. Obi-Wan's won because of such a tactical advantage. Then Anakin makes it exceedingly obvious as to what he's going to do next, making him lose the rest of his limbs. Why would he do that and then make so obvious a move? Why not jump to the lower part of the slope or more to the side? I don't understand his reasoning. He has more than enough time to plan it out. Was it because he wanted to show-up Obi-Wan and his reasoning being clouded from his rage? If his anger was so great why didn't he make more mistakes during the rest of the duel?

&amp;#x200B;

The last things that I'll point to are Obi-Wan's leaving of Anakin to a particularly horrid fate of being burned alive. I know he's doing terrible things, but that seems particularly vindictive. Especially to someone who was like a brother to him. Followed by picking up Anakin's presumably scalding hot lightsaber from volcanic rock.

&amp;#x200B;

So, those are my qualms with the fight. My apologies for dragging it out, but I wanted to be thorough with my thoughts. And now I'd like to hear others. Is there something I'm missing? Does the duel hold up to today? Is the fight good or bad?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: 

Friends watched prequels, said they were bad.

Watched the duel b/w Anakin and Obi-Wan. Disapointed.

Too much spinning to imply good choreography.

Some weird shots.

Felt too choreographed.

CG was okay, I think.

Dialogue corny but is fine for drama.

HIGH GROUND

Anakin sets himself up to fail at the end.

Obi-Wan lets Anakin burn to death.

state flux arguably voyager biggest missed opportunity,"For better or worse, *Voyager* is my favorite series in the franchise, but that doesn't mean that I'm unaware of its flawed execution. We can all agree that the Kazon arc was over-played and messy, but one thing I never see anyone talk about is how much this episode wasted Seska's potential.

Let's look back a few episodes to ""Prime Factors."" The Maquis are obviously willing to break the rules to get home a little faster, and they find an unlikely ally in Starfleet's engineer poster boy, Joe Carey. Suddenly, we're shown that an officer who's been loyal to Janeway since the ship left spacedock is willing to break with her policy of following Federation directives.

So, what if the writers had committed to actually making Joe Carey the traitor instead of Seska? What if Carey just wanted to keep himself as safe as possible so he could get home to see his family again? What if Seska *really did* go over to the Kazon ship to prove that she wasn't the traitor, just to accidentally out herself as a Cardassian on a ship full of former Maquis?

Think about the dramatic implications of this. Nevermind turning Carey into a recurring villain, they'd probably just kill him off. Focus on what Seska now brings to the table. Suddenly, this woman that B'Elanna, Chakotay, and all the other Maquis all knew and trusted for years is shown to be everything they all hate and fought against. Now, ironically, the only people Seska can trust to treat her fairly are the Starfleet officers on board.

This would have been a far more bold direction than what we got, and considering that Martha Hackett played the hell out of the role as it was written, I'm sure it would have been amazing to watch. Such a shame it didn't work out that way.",startrek,1577763642,PresidentMagikarp,9,1,True,2019-12-30

question borg,"I know the Both were introduced to be the ultimate enemy of the Federation, and for a while they felt almost unstoppable. In TNG The Best of Both Worlds, one Cube almost destroys Earth. So no doubt the Federation sees them as a huge threat. 

Being that they are the number one enemy of the Federation, why doesn't the Federation intruduce new hand to hand training techniques specifically designed to fight the Borg? For instance, Worf proves that an individual Borg is vulnerable to sword melee attacks. So one would think that next to the phaser rifle and pistol in the weapons closet, you would start to see swords that could be enhanced to easily cut through Borg exoskeletons/suits.

Pulling from a different universe, but a Vibroblade tech would be incredibly useful.

Maybe I am missing something, maybe the Borg armor is too tough for melee weapons. And this wouldn't help ship vs ship, but at least if they beamed over a Boarding party, you would have some defence against them when they adapted to your phasers.",startrek,1577827786,Nacido_Del_Sol,29,1,True,2019-12-31

season episode star trek next generation tapestry overarching premise movie shrek however conclusions could different,"So I was watching Shrek 4 recently because it's the best film to ring in the new decade.

At the start of Tapestry Captain Picard goes to sickbay due to sustaining unexpected injuries. It's at this point he finds himself ""dead"". He talks to Q (**a being with godlike powers**), and mentions the regrets of his youth. He took risks as a young man, ended up in a fight with some Nausicaans, and had his natural heart replaced with an artificial one. **The only reason he is in this situation now is because of his past actions that he regrets.** 

Whereas with Shrek 4, Shrek is at a birthday party for his son. (An odd parallel here is that the actor who plays young Picard is also Patrick Stewart's son, this must be a subtle nod to the Shrek franchise.) He is strained and bored by married life. He eventually roars and runs off in a huff, having punched the birthday cake. He visits Rumpelstiltskin (**a being with godlike powers**) and mentions the regrets of being in the cinematic disaster Shrek the Third and wishes for it to be retconned. **The only reason he is in this situation now is because of his past actions that he regrets.** 

So, that's the initial setup. In Star Trek, the act of changing the past is done by not fighting the Nausicaans, whereas in Shrek 4 it's achieved by signing the contract. 

Either way, **both end up back in the present day with the past having been changed as they desired**. In both worlds neither Shrek nor Picard are well known (if they existed in the same universe, they would be brothers). 

Initially, **both are happy with their decisions**. Picard is alive as a Junior Science Officer, and Shrek is living the carefree life as an Ogre. **Both are free of significant responsibility**, as Picard is no longer Captain and Shrek doesn't have a family to care for. 

The revelation, brought by Q/Rumpelstiltskin is that they cannot go back. In the case of Tapestry, this is because if he goes back he will be dead. In the case of Rumpelstiltskin's deal, Rumpelstiltskin removed the day Shrek was born, and therefore he doesn't exist. 

Q is more of a force for good if we look at the Star Trek side, (if it even is Q) whereas Rumpel reverted time for his own gain. 

In either case, **both Jean Luc and Shrek regret their decision of changing the past**. 

BUT, here's the kicker.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Shrek wanted to get back to his boring life because otherwise he would be dead.**  
**Picard wanted to get back to his death because he could not stand having such a boring life.** 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

In either case, Shrek does true love's kiss and goes back to exactly where he left. Picard argues with Q to get him to revert himself back to his deathbed. 

Finally, if Sean Connery tried to make a portmanteau of Star Trek, it would be Shrek.

When her crew disagrees she threatens them, when her first officer objects, which is his job, she confines him to quarters. She makes decisions to put the whole crew at risk to save one life but she also decides to let whole worlds die due to the prime directive but also disobeys or ""bends it"" as she would say.

Neelix is an overgrown rat but his decisions rarely matter and don't put the crew at risk. When one of her crew boned someone she reprimanded him but two episodes latter she fell in love with a hologram, she constantly treats the doctor like a tricorder and doesn't take his opinions into account. Matter of fact she doesn't listen to anyone on the crew, Chipotle disagrees with her because her moral high ground is wrong she tells him to shut up and know his place, the doctor gives him his professional opinion she doesn't care
 
Now talking about Tuvix. As much of a monstrosity this thing was, it was a living sentient creature that was forced to be killed, killing one person to save two is morally wrong, especially if the one who is dieing is unwilling to he sacrificed.

I figure it will sort of give me a slice of life of the Federation and help get me through the rough beginning of DS9, plus it might also work for helping me continue on to the rest of the Voyager episodes I have never finished.

enjoy janeway character male,"I know a lot has been said about Janeway here. As others have said, and I agree, she is impulsive, erratic, disrespectful of ethical constraints and protocol. But, none of that is Mulgrew's fault (although, I don't like her acting, either). The writer's decided this was how her character was going to behave.

My post isn't about what I don't like about her--plenty--but *why* don't I like her exhibited behavior? Surely, other people like her character. They see her as strong, determinant, bold, bent on doing anything to keep her people safe and headed towards home.

So, do I not like Janeway because her character is poorly written, or can I just not stand her because she's a strong woman?

\--

This argument is somewhat rhetorical. I don't have a problem with most other female characters--Uhura, Crusher, Troi, Ro, Dax. But, again, I do have a problem with Kira. I don't seem to enjoy the most common two highest-ranking female characters in Trek.

Pattern, or coincidence?

I came to this realization after going through another re-watch of Voyager. Raven (S04E06) is emblematic of all things wrong with Trek / Voyager.

- The enterprise gets destroyed in both movies

Now, time for the confusing theory. I believe that in both movies, Bones and Spock are stranded together somewhere where no one can reach them. In Beyond, they are physically stranded on one area of the planet while the other crew members are somewhere else. In Search for Spock, Bones and Spock are essentially stranded together inside Bones’s mind.

Gambit is a bit weak, Sub Rosa is hilariously bad.. but that's really the extent of my problems with season 7.  Lower Decks was much better than it had any right to be, and frankly I'm disappointed we never got to see more of those characters throughout the franchise; they were all likable.  

OK, Homeward also is the one time I actually got kinda pissed off at the cast for being a bunch of sanctimonious ass-hats since the 1st season.  Maybe I'm answering my own question but -as a whole- I think it's dumped on way too much.

ED:  I had to stop myself from side rambling about Homeward.  Out of all of TNG's run, that's the only episode that makes me want to go 'Oh, screw you' to the crew.  But it's not enough to kill the season by any means.  It's more just the show being tainted by Voyager's dogmatic ridiculous application of the Prime Directive in the dumbest of ways.

The plot involved a mind-meld with Janeway and Tuvok to relive an old memory of when Tuvok was an ensign on the USS Excelsior under the command of Captian Sulu during the time of The Undiscovered Country. It was a decent episode but one conversation jumped out at me. Janway was reminiscing with Ensign Kim about what it would have been like to be in Starfleet back during that time and Kim made a comment about there being ""no replicators, no holodecks"".

Original post:

&gt;**Here's a thought: How about an AR Star Trek game? You play a Starfleet officer performing covert surveilance on a pre-warp civilization bearing remarkable resemblance to 21st century Earth. Your only tool is your tricorder, perfectly disguised to resemble the natives' ""smart phone"" technology.** 📷   
&gt;  
&gt;Get missions from your handler stationed in orbit, fight a shadow war against the Devidians from Time's Arrow or some other invisible aliens, and live every day like you're a Starfleet officer on a secret mission! Would you play?

Also from u/targetpractice_v01, in response to u/benzado's comment that the Prime Directive would prevent such action:

&gt;Maybe the mission revolves around cleaning up the mess of another Federation ship. That way it's upholding the Prime Directive. Like some other ship tried to scan a nearby interphasic rift or something and unleashed a bunch of pah wraith-sorta things, and now they're invading this planet and you have to go down there and catch 'em all--er, I mean, push them back into their native dimensional fold, yeah.

Again from u/targetpractice_v01:

&gt;The funny thing is, everyone's assuming time travel (maybe because I mention Time's Arrow?) but it doesn't take place on 21st century earth, it exists on an alien planet a lot \*like\* 21st century Earth. Like how classic Star Trek episodes sometimes took place on worlds a lot like Earth when they wanted to explore a modern theme. Thus we got Kirk waving an American flag and shouting the Declaration of Independence and Riker having ""alien"" sex with a UFO fanatic. In this case, you get all the ordinary trappings of modern life, but you can pretend everyone has eyebrow ridges or something, I dunno.

u/notheebie suggested that it could be used to croudsource work for good causes:

&gt;Could use it for social projects too like, ""Starfleet needs a team to cleanup xyz river! Fill up a trash bag with waste and dispose properly to complete your mission""

To which u/targetpractice_v01 replied:

&gt;That would be great! I was thinking how a game like this could have a positive impact by encouraging the players to think like Starfleet officers and hold themselves to Starfleet standards in their daily lives. The game could take it to the next level by partnering with local non-profits to sponsor volunteer events with in-game activities and special rewards.

**Okay**

**Below Average**

* Final Mission (Picard-Wes convo only thing that saves this from bad)


**Bad**

* The Loss (Yikes, Deanna. Awful writing, awful execution)
* Night Terrors (crew going mad episodes are the worst, pls stop making them)


**Wtf was this** 

* none



Yes I know having all the two parters as creme de la creme is lame but imo they really knew what they did and why they made those two parters and I thoroughly enjoy them (spoiler, the next two parter will be up there too). 

Data's day a classic, don't think I need to say too much about that one. 

The Drumhead a wonderful Picard episode with an important message that imo could have been done well as a two parter too. Also, Simon Tarses' father/mother must be the most interesting character in the Quadrant we never see. 

Family was just a wonderful transition episode after BoBW and probably one of our all's fav Picard episodes. 

Brothers was equally great of a Data episode, the interactions with Dr.Soong were wonderful and sadly way too short. #F*ckLore

Half a life the first good lwaxana episode haha, she was still annoying at the start and in parts throughout it but the scientist was played wonderfully and seems like one of the nicest persons in the universe. Great conflict pointed out in this episode too. Really good stuff. 

In Theory was really sweet until the end parts. Picard randomly flying the shuttle when Data clearly is the best choice was just nonsense and bad writing imo and bugged me quite a bit. 

Future Imperfect tricked me quite a bit even on the rewatch and I'm glad it did, sadly the revelation towards the end made it less exciting for me. 

Final Mission is a massive yikes and horrible plot, however the Picard Wesley moments save it a little, especially the convo at the end. 

Hate me but I personally enjoyed Wesley and like the character. After he left every episode started to feel more serious, not sure if that was intended or just me. 

The Loss and Night Terrors are two awful Deanna episodes again.. I'm really sorry Deanna but you always get the shit character episodes, but the acting also isn't great . Her sobbing and cries of pain just feel so fake and sound just ugh. Nothing against Marina but thats just how I feel.

would different star trek shows us going wrong create plot episode would actually go wrong real spaceship,"Seems like at least fifty percent of problems on Starfleet ships would not happen if people just followed proper security protocol.

For example, wouldn't every terminal be locked until and unless a permitted crew member needed to access information? There would be public terminals that would be amped-up wikis, and google search engines, but wouldn't give you access to any internal ship systems, no matter how hard you try--and if you do try, security is alerted.

So many episodes hinge on a crew member just taking for granted whatever excuse another person gives for accessing a data terminal. If rotating shift codes (like 2FA, but 300 years more advanced) were needed to log-in, then rogue agents wouldn't be downloading data from the ship's computer.

But just once I would like the Enterprise to just wreck someone's shit. When has the Enterprise just curb-stomped something, without getting blown to pieces first? The closest I can think of is the when the E destroyed the Plot Advancement Generator in First Contact , destroying a cube in minutes that took a fleet of ships days to even scratch (which even then, it spent the rest of the movie getting assimilated, so it got curb-stomped from inside)...or maybe if we're stretching it, in the 2009 movie when the Enterprise destroyed the Narada, but that was while it was being eaten by a black hole and  I....well we're just not gonna get into that, that's a whole separate post, but it's even more jarring when there's so much lore or when the characters outright state that the Enterprise is the ""newest/most advanced ship in the fleet"", and then it gets its ass handed to it. Just once I'd like to see it go toe-to-toe with, say, its Klingon or Romulan counterpart, no Macguffin, no Polarity Reversal, just standard starship engagement and decisive victory.

*""Hall took a handful of people under his personal wing each year, for fast-tracking through the mysteries.  One of them was [Don Ingalls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Ingalls), who credits Hall with his successes as a film and television writer.  He wrote *Have Gun - Will Travel*, *Bonanza* and *Fantasy Island*, for those of you who may be old enough to remember such things.*

*""He was in the police department at the time and his partner was Gene Roddenberry, who created Star Trek.  A talk on [Blavatsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blavatsky) by Hall involving parallel universes became a Star Trek episode.*

*""Ingalls believes the popularity of the show stems from the themes of decency, morality, sacrifice for the common good.  He says, *'In a broad sense, my time with Manly helped expand my views of life.  His teachings of the great schools of philosophy were very helpful in my creative endeavors.  They expanded my capability and added a sense of balance, calmness, and self-control.  Basically, Hall helped me to develop a different personal balance system than chasing women and the fast buck, one based on honest labor and poise under pressure.'""*

e pegasus picard unreasonable hypocritical,"When he confronts Riker about the actual events on the Pegasus he gets visibly frustrated at Riker for essentially following orders.  From Rikers point of view, he was told by his commanding officer to cover up the events.  Starfleet themselves back this up by covering it up (perhaps not sanctioned at the highest levels, but high enough to include several top brass) Riker, from his limited viewpoint as an ensign was doing as he was told.

Now Picard has to pull favours to view the report, suggesting he wasn't supposed to see so he himself is presumably breaking orders or at least protocol by accessing info he knowingly isn't supposed to see.  He then ends up getting angry at Riker for rightly saying you need to speak with the Admiral.

How many times has Picard had to keep secrets from his staff based on superior orders? He came across as very hypocritical IMO because he wasn't in the loop.

question episode next generation,"In Season 1, Episode 24 (titled ""We'll Always Have Paris""), the crew of the Enterprise experiences a distortion in time. They eventually discover that the distortion was caused by the experiments of Dr. Paul Manheim. Dr. Manheim had been experimenting with the effects of gravity and time, and had found a way to contact another universe. However, his experiments were causing distortions across several thousand light years, and Captain Picard decides to send Commander Data down alone to stop the experiment, as Data was the least affected by the effects of the time distortion. Near the end of the episode, Data must dispense a specific amount of antimatter into the dimensional ""window"" to close it. He then asks Geordi to set a countdown for him on his mark. Now, my question is, why would data need a countdown when he is perfectly capable of, counting it himself in his positronic brain, with significantly higher accuracy than possible by a human? The distortion dud cause three total Datas to appear simultaneously, but they were collectively determine which was the correct Data and close the window at the correct time.

man galaxy child worse remember,"Going back through it to get material to to make /r/leahbrahmsmemes a big hit.  I know this has been discussed before, but it was either write this or reflect on why I was spending hours taking screenshots and making gifs on a Star Trek character that appears in 2 episodes.  So here we are.

Geordi is told Dr. Brahms is coming to visit.  He immediately celebrates in front of Picard, who is confused but does not really care.  He then talks to Guinan about meeting his ""dream"" and how he does not necessarily have romantic intentions.

Upon meeting, they instantly forge a cold relationship, arguing about his changes to Enterprise, which she designed.  From the get go, Geordi constantly makes weird comments demonstrating he knows a lot about her.  When she confronts him on this in the engine room, he becomes angry and confrontational.  To smooth things over, he offers dinner at his place and she agrees.

Despite what he said earlier about romance, when then get a long scene of Geordi setting the mood for a dinner date with Dr. Brahms.  He spends time lowering the lighting and picking music.  When she shows up, she is instantly uncomfortable with the setting, commenting on Geordi not wearing his uniform.  He says he did it to make HER comfortable.

They sit and start talking, and Geordi continues for no reason to creepily comment on how he knows and understands her, eventually shifting to sit closer to her.  When she opens up and says she is not often comfortable around people, Geordi says she hasn't met the right people.  He is coming on very, very strong.

She eventually says she needs to leave as it is not appropriate.  When asking about when they can meet the next day, Georgi responds in a curt, hurt tone.

Crawling around in Fefferies tubes or some shit, Leah finally confronts Geordi about how weird he is acting.  Geordi kind of lies and says he has always been a big fan of her work and that he thinks they could become ""maybe good friends"".  She drops the bomb that she is married.  Insanely, he never bothered to look this up.

Geordi tells Guinan about how sad he is.  She tries to remind him that Leah is a person and he fell in love with a non-person.  Geordi sighs heavily.

Of course, Leah finds he program with her recreating.  He rushed over but it is too late.  She is angry, understandably I think.  Again maybe the fact that he did it is not super weird? People argue that all the time.  But what stood out to me was that he was so dishonest about it to her from the start.

Anyway, Geordi explains it wasn't like a sex doll thing but she doesn't believe him because, again, he lied about everything else up to this point.

He then goes FULL NICE GUY and explains how fucking patience and nice her has been to her since she has been here.  He has the balls to say he is ""guilty of reaching out to her"" when he has been trying to get in her pants since she showed up.  He leaves.

Anyway, they get rid of a space baby or something and seem to be fast friends now.  She then tries to apologize to him.  In his defense he does admit he should of been straight with her from the beginning.

With how the Season 3 finale of Disco ends, we can see that the Picard series is officially a prequel series like Enterprise and Discovery season 1 and 2 were, and undoubtedly doomed to fail just like ENT and DSC. Frankly, I'd like to see Trek keep blazing a new path into the future, not taking niche characters from 80's shows and trying to shoehorn in new stories in a tiny pocket of a huge universe.

/s (But it IS a prequel show now!)

Also, I think as a fandom we need to get a little more fun about TLAs for shows. I REALLY thought we should have been using STD for Disco because it's funny, and if not that, then DIS. And for Picard, we're going with PIC? I vote for STP, because he's keeping the engine running and he rocks.

extensive list episodes movies watch premiere picard,"My wife and son are *Star Trek* fans, but they're not as afflicted as I am, so I curated a selection of episodes to watch before the debut of *Picard*.  I chose episodes based on their focus, so long as they fell into one of five categories: Picard episode, Data episode, Seven episode, Romulan episode, and Borg episode.  Also, every episode I chose had to at least be ""pretty good.""

(Of course, at this stage, we don't really know how much screen time Seven will get in the new series, for example, so watching a bunch of *Voyager* episodes may prove to be a waste of time if she's only in it for an episode.  That's the risk and your mileage may vary.)  

In order:

*ENT* - ""Minefield""

(See below for ""Regeneration"")

*ENT* - ""United""

*ENT* - ""The Aenar""

*TOS* - ""Balance of Terror""

(Didn't include ""The Deadly Years"" as the Romulans weren't really a focus of the episode.)

*TOS* - ""The Enterprise Incident""

*TNG* - ""Encounter at Farpoint""

*TNG* - ""The Battle""

*TNG* - ""Datalore""

(Didn't choose ""The Neutral Zone"" because the Romulan story was a relatively minor B-plot compared to the awakened cryo-sleepers.)

*TNG* - ""The Measure of a Man""

*TNG* - ""Q Who""

*TNG* - ""Who Watches the Watchers""

*TNG* - ""The Enemy""

*TNG* - ""The Defector""

*TNG* - ""The Offspring""

*TNG* - ""Allegiance""

*TNG* - ""Captain's Holiday""

*TNG* - ""Sarek""

*TNG* - ""The Best of Both Worlds""

(Just for kicks, when Admiral Hanson's signal cut out during the Battle of Wolf 359, I paused the Blu-ray and went to the CBS app and we watched the first few minutes of *DS9*'s ""The Emissary.""  It was pretty cool.)

*TNG* - ""Family""

*TNG* - ""Brothers""

*TNG* - ""Data's Day""

*TNG* - ""Qpid""

*TNG* - ""The Drumhead""

*TNG* - ""The Mind's Eye""

*TNG* - ""Darmok""

*TNG* - ""Unification""

*TNG* - ""I, Borg""

*TNG* - ""The Inner Light""

*TNG* - ""Chain of Command""

*TNG* - ""Face of the Enemy""

*TNG* - ""Tapestry""

*TNG* - ""Starship Mine""

*TNG* - ""Lessons""

*TNG* - ""The Chase""

*TNG* - ""Descent""

*TNG* - ""Gambit""

*TNG* - ""Attached""

*TNG* - ""The Pegasus"" (At least for the teaser scene set on ""Captain Picard Day"")

*TNG* - ""All Good Things ...""

*Star Trek: Generations*

(I contemplated adding some *DS9* Romulan episodes, but because the Romulans were present only as a player in the Dominion War, that felt a bit off topic.)

*Star Trek: First Contact*

*ENT* - ""Regeneration""

*VOY* - ""Scorpion""

*VOY* - ""The Raven""

*VOY* - ""The Omega Directive""

*VOY* - ""Drone""

*VOY* - ""Infinite Regress""

*VOY* - ""Dark Frontier""

*VOY* - ""Someone to Watch Over Me""

*VOY* - ""Child's Play""

*VOY* - ""Unimatrix Zero""

*VOY* - ""Imperfection""

*VOY* - ""Body and Soul""

*VOY* - ""Human Error""

*VOY* - ""Endgame""

*Star Trek: Nemesis*

*Star Trek* (2009) - specifically, Spock Prime's mind meld with Kirk

*Short Treks* - ""Children of Mars"" (hasn't been released at the time of this writing, but we've been told it ties in)

And that's it.  I plainly state that this list is made up of episodes that *I* find to be most interesting and connected to each of the categories I wanted (Picard, Data, Seven, Romulans, Borg).  If there's an episode you would have included that I didn't, by all means, insert it yourself in your own rewatch.  Like I said, YMMV.

odd voyager list rank characters opening credits discovery even worse,"1. During the opening credits of Voyager, only Janeway is given a rank, ""Kate Mulgrew as Captain Kathryn Janeway"". Every other actor / character is only defined by their real name, and their character name--no other ranks are given. I watched TNG as it aired live (Thursday nights at 8), and every character's name, as well as the actor's real name is seared into my memory. Not that anybody would, but someone could ask me any variation of who played what character, or what rank did ""Levar Burton's character have on Star Trek?"", and I could tell you (along with millions of other fans, I'm sure). I never built an internal catalog of what ranks existed on the Voyager Bridge, and I think it hurt my familiarity with the show.
2. Neelix, Seven, and The Doctor don't have ranks. Why not? Troi had a rank. Janeway gave Seven systems access (until she disobeyed a direct order and lost the privilege), so she must have had an equivalent of rank. The same goes for Neelix, and The Doctor.
3. Discovery is worse than Voyager in terms of opening credits. Only actor names are given, no character names, and no ranks. It's ""easy enough"" (but I shouldn't have to) to look them up (not the case back in the early 1990's unless you bought a sourcebook!), but I could probably only get half the character names (and first names at that, except for Burnham--okay, Stamets too, because I actually have one of the real Stamets' mycology books) right on a impromptu quiz... Tilly, Michael, Paul, Phillipa... I'm missing so many more characters. I definitely could not tell you actors' names, nor their ranks of the Discovery crew. I think it was a poor choice to omit this information for the audience. ""Gates McFadden as Dr. Beverly Crusher"", etc. Each member of the TNG Bridge Crew had their own ""screen shot"" that is indelibly etched in the minds of tens-of-millions of fans around the world, along with a certain part of the opening score.

I don't want to discuss too much because if you have seen it, you know it, and if you haven't you should watch it fresh.

I think this is one of the greatest episodes of all Star Trek. At least top 20 of mine, and I have watched everything at least twice. 

Without talking too much about the plot, I'll try to describe why I give it credit. This is one of Voyager's best episodes as it takes place solely within the bounds of the ship and is a character driven plot. I think those are some of Voyager's best kind, although not essential. Each character truly has their own moment, and it's pretty genuine. I feel the rest of the series can get a little sappy where characters seem to literally say things like ""Well you know me, I'm always the one to do that type of thing"", they characters really come together. Moments of beauty. In fact I might say this episode also has one of the most touching Tuvok moments where he expresses his affection to Janeway with such a simple act (almost a non-act) , but knowing what that means to him is a highlight of his character.

Why I would suggest it is one of the greatest episodes across all series is, again trying not to reveal too much, the crew is faced with a problem they can't face. No sudden getting warp drive back on line. No sudden adjustment of some deflector pulse. No out. The crew has to face a power beyond them. And do they face it with dignity?

###A Crash Course on Jean-Luc Picard


##Star Trek: The Next Generation, “Family”

In the wake of being captured and absorbed into the Borg Collective in the season three finale and season four premiere, Picard returns home on shore leave for the first time in almost 20 years. The trauma of the Borg’s torture weighs heavily on Picard, even as he claims he is alright. While most of his family greets him warmly, Picard’s brother is cold towards him due to their differing outlooks on technology and the future. Ultimately, they are able to reconcile, but not before Picard has to confront his own trauma. 

At one point, Picard talks to his friend Louis about how while he was happy his family kept traditions alive, he wasn’t bound to those traditions. Louis replies that Picard always reached for the future. We know that Picard has returned to his family’s vineyard, so what drove him to abandon the future in pursuit of the past? That might be a mystery left for the pilot of Picard, but this is an excellent episode for fans to get a feel for Picard’s psychology and deepen the mystery of what could have made him leave Starfleet.

Tragedy struck the Picard family in the movie Star Trek: Generations, during which Picard finds out that his brother and nephew have died in a fire. Picard is now the last of his family, and without him, there is no one to keep the traditions alive. This is yet another tragedy for the captain, and sets up the groundwork for his ultimate return to the family vineyard.


##Star Trek: The Next Generation, Episode “The Drumhead”

After the warp drive is damaged and Romulan interference is suspected, retired Admiral Norah Satie is brought on to find who on the Enterprise could be a spy. Despite finding a Klingon officer who is leaking information, it is revealed that the supposed sabotage was in fact a simple malfunction and not an attack. Satie is unsatisfied, though, and begins a fanatical hunt to find a traitor on the Enterprise, much to Picard’s dismay. 

This is an episode that showcases Picard’s strong sense of justice. He says he will not treat a man as a criminal unless there is cause to do so, and he stands tall in defense of his crew and himself. Picard is firm, but he stands for the scales of justice in the universe being balanced. He will not allow anyone to remove due process or to play judge and jury. We can assume that Picard’s innate sense of righteousness and justice will come into play as he faces the Romulans in their newly imperiled state in Picard, because one of the reasons Picard is such a powerful character is that he will do the right thing to ensure that justice is served, not revenge


##Star Trek: The Next Generation, Episode “The First Duty”

Picard imparts an important lesson to young Wesley Crusher in this episode. When Wesley’s squadron suffers an accident that costs a cadet his life, it is revealed the squadron was attempting a banned maneuver. Ultimately, Wesley reveals the truth at a hearing to uncover what happens, and Picard’s trust in him is restored. Picard comforts Wesley and says that while the immediate future will be hard, ultimately he will have respect and trust from his fellow students again, even if Wesley doubts this.

Picard has unwavering faith in his crew and his family, including Wesley. When that trust is broken, he does not immediately berate Wesley and cut him out of his family but offers him a chance to fix his mistakes. His offer of a way to mend this broken trust shows the empathetic side of the captain, and his unshakable trust in those he cares for. Picard, even with his stern nature, has always been incredibly kind and loyal to his own crew. This is what makes him such a strong captain, and reminds us why so many are willing to follow him into the jaws of death.


##Star Trek: The Next Generation, Episode: “The Inner Light”

In one of the best hours of Trek from any series, Picard finds himself living a whole new life in a dreamlike state. On the planet Kataan, Picard is now known as Kamin, a regular man with a wife and a family. Twenty minutes pass as the Enterprise crew tries to revive their captain, but during that short period of time Picard lives an entire lifetime on the dying world, experiencing the planet’s culture and world even as it enters its final years. 

It is revealed that the inhabitants of the planet sent the probe into so that someone, “a teacher,” could learn about them and remember them following their planet’s demise. The probe found Picard, and so he carries with him a civilization that has been dead a thousand years. It’s a deeply moving episode that sets up the idea of Picard as someone who carries the legacy of those who have come before inside of him. If you need a reminder of Picard’s capacity for empathy and compassion, this is the perfect example. Besides, it’s a phenomenal episode in the Trek canon, and worth a revisit just to be reminded of the highest of highs from the franchise. 


##Star Trek: The Next Generation, Episodes “Chain of Command, Part I and II”

While on a secret mission to destroy a Cardassian biological weapon, Picard is captured and tortured both physically and psychologically by a ruthless military leader. While he is ultimately saved, he privately admits to counselor Deanna Troi that he was at his breaking point by the time of his release and was willing to do anything to get the torture to stop, even if he was rescued before he had the chance to break under the strain.

Picard has endured many traumas in his life and his time as the captain of the Enterprise, but it is important that he admits his own humanity in these moments. Weakness is not a failure, not to him, and he allows himself moments where he can be human rather than a stalwart captain. If Picard can survive and endure, then we can all take lessons from him that we can also endure our own personal traumas. Picard survives, no matter what. We, the viewers, can all survive as well. 


##Star Trek: The Next Generation, Episode “Tapestry”

After an attack during a mission, Picard is sent into cardiac arrest as his artificial heart is put under strain. When he “dies” from his wounds, he runs into old friend Q, who gives him the chance to relive the events that led to him receiving an artificial heart. These events would have led to his survival during that particular mission, but he would not have become the captain of the Enterprise due to an aversion to risk. Picard declares he’d rather die as captain than live as no one. Q returns him to his timeline, where he survives and reflects on his experience.

Q tells Picard that his near death experience as a cadet taught him about his mortality and how life is too short to play it safe. This led to Picard being the man he is during the events of Next Generation and the ensuing films. Picard knows that his life is too brief to waste it by doing nothing. He must take action, which makes his new profession in Picard so interesting. There is nothing wasteful about returning to his family’s vineyard, but it is not as risky or remarkable as his time as captain.

Could Picard see something that challenges his worldview in the beginning of the upcoming series? What could happen that could make Picard choose a safer path? And is it even a safer path, or is there a secret behind Picard’s newfound quiet life? 


##Star Trek: Insurrection

In the third film featuring the Next Generation crew, Picard discovers a plot by the Son’a people to forcibly relocate the peaceful Ba’ku people so they can exploit their planet for its rejuvenating properties; the process would poison the planet with radiation, rendering it unlivable. Picard ultimately stops the Son’a from harvesting the planet which leads to the Ba’ku forgiving the Son’a and reuniting their people. 

When Picard finds out that the Federation is involved with the Son’a’s plot, he does not stand by. Instead he fights for what he feels is ultimately right. We know that Picard is not above disobeying orders and fighting for the little guy when he knows it is right, which is key to both his character and to the philosophy of Star Trek in general. 

When faced with his new challenges in Picard, will our captain once more have to rebel against Starfleet? We know he leaves his role as admiral, which points to a philosophical break between the two. Picard’s inner sense of right and wrong is key to his character, and I can’t wait to see what drives him to both leave Starfleet and, later, return to the stars. 



###Learn to Love The Borg


##Star Trek: The Next Generation, Episodes “The Best of Both Worlds, Part I and II”

In this harrowing season finale, Picard is captured by the Borg and turned into Locutus, mouthpiece for the Borg army. The Enterprise faces a horrible choice: fire upon the Borg ship and destroy their captain, or allow the Borg to continue traveling towards Earth. Riker, acting as captain, makes the choice to fire on the ship… but thankfully, the Borg are undamaged and the crew has a second chance to save their captain. 

Picard is ultimately rescued and returned to his human state, but at great cost to his mind and body. The torture he underwent with the Borg was immense, and it deeply impacted the character and his relationship with the Borg going forward. As one of his archenemies, the Borg might have exacted the greatest personal toll from him. And yet, Picard remains the steadfast leader he has always been. It just takes some healing, as we saw in the episode “Family.” 


##Star Trek: The Next Generation, Episode: “I, Borg”

Picard faces off against the Borg again when the away team discovers an injured Borg drone on an icy planet. When Dr. Crusher is unable to stand by and let the drone die, Picard allows her to bring him on board. When he learns that he has the chance to use their prisoner to end the Borg threat, ultimately Picard chooses to let the newly named Hugh live, rather than destroy the entire Collective.

This episode presents Picard with a difficult philosophical question. Is all fair in the battle against the Borg? Is an individual to blame for all the sins the Borg have committed? When encountering Hugh, Picard’s assumptions about the Borg are challenged, and in doing so Picard becomes a stronger, better leader. It shows his willingness to find the humanity in all he meets, even if he is facing off against an enemy that has never extended him or his crew the same grace.

This is particularly important in the wake of “The Best of Both Worlds,” during which the Borg tortured Picard. The Borg were more than willing to destroy Picard for their own gains, but he is not willing to exact revenge in a manner that would be both cruel and unusual. This marks Picard’s humanity, and his compassionate nature. He is tough, but never cruel, and that is what makes him stand out as a character.


##Star Trek: First Contact

With the Borg headed for Earth, Picard is drawn back into the fray against this treacherous enemy. The Borg travel back in time to prevent first contact between humans and Vulcans and assimilate the planet, but the Enterprise, along with a couple intrepid new friends, are able to stop them by neutralizing their threat. While most of the Borg still exist in the future, the Borg Queen is taken out, alongside her ship.

The Borg are complicated and fascinating villains, and it will be interesting to see how they are featured in Picard. As with many characters, Picard ventures beyond the end of the known timeline to explore the future of Starfleet. Have the Borg recovered their power to try and take over the universe again, or are they now refugees and scattered survivors? Again, these are the questions we’ll have to wait to answer.


##Star Trek: Voyager, Episode “The Raven”

The only Voyager episode on our list, this episode focuses on Seven of Nine, who will be making an appearance in Star Trek: Picard. Recently freed from the Borg Collective, she is trying to learn once more to be human. She ultimately discovers her parent's ship, the Raven, which she was assimilated on when the Borg captured her and her family years before. When Janeway, at the end of the episode, offers to give her records of her parents, she says that she'll read them one day.

Seven of Nine is a beloved character, and this episode highlights her nuance and complexity. It also highlights the tragic nature of her life. Assimilation isn't easy, and her struggle to become human again shows her courage. What will she be like when Picard runs into her out in the universe? We can only wait to see.



###Getting to Know Data


##Star Trek: The Next Generation, Episode “Datalore”

In one of the first episodes to highlight Data and his brother, Lore, “Datalore” features Brent Spiner playing both androids. It also serves as an origin story, as it explains where Data came from and who made him. While Lore is a decidedly evil creation, Data serves as a figure of good. Lore says he is the second and more “perfect” model, he’s lying and is envious of Data being the second and improved creation.

This episode drew praise for Spiner’s performance, and it highlights not only Data’s loyalty to the crew but the goodness seemingly coded into his being. 


##Star Trek: The Next Generation, Episode “The Measure of a Man”

The debate over Data’s personhood rages on in this episode, as the crew engages in a debate over whether or not Data is a person or if he is property of Starfleet. When a Starfleet officer wants to experiment on Data, Riker is forced to argue against Data’s personhood, though ultimately Data and Picard are able to prove that Data is a sentient being and therefore entitled to the autonomy of making his own choices.

This is a key episode in Data’s story. He is more than a machine used by Starfleet, but instead is a deeply human character, even if he is an android. Data displays the human trait of forgiveness both towards the officer who wanted to experiment on him and towards Riker, who deeply regrets his role in the proceedings. To paraphrase Captain Kirk, of all the souls Picard and the Enterprise met on their journeys, Data’s might be the most human.


##Star Trek: The Next Generation, Episode “Brothers”

Lore and Dr. Noonien Soong, Data’s creator, are both back in this episode that once more highlight’s Data’s humanity. Both Data and Lore are recalled to Soong's deathbed, where he intends to give Data a chip that allows him to experience emotions. However, Lore deceives Soong and is able to receive the chip instead. Data apologizes for not being able to grieve his creator's loss and returns to the Enterprise, where he reflects on what has happened.

Data's quest for emotions is key to his character, and this episode highlights this journey. While Lore ultimately gets the chip, Data remains the more human of the two brothers. Even without a chip to experience emotions, Data can still be empathetic to a degree his brother cannot.



###Everything You Need to Know About Romulans


##Star Trek: The Next Generation, “The Defector”

Picard tries to help a Romulan admiral defecting from the Empire in this episode. Admiral Jarok makes the choice to never see his family again to help the Federation; ultimately, his defection is used by the Romulans to stage a trap for the Enterprise. Though Jarok kills himself, Picard is left with a note for Jarok's family and the knowledge that some Romulans have the courage to push back against the Romulan Empire. 

This is a key episode for Romulan-Federation relationships, and establishes that while Picard isn't the biggest fan of the Romulans, he respects them. Given the pending destruction of the Romulan homeworld, this is incredibly important. After all, Picard will be faced with the decision to extend his hand to help the Romulans, even after fighting with them in various episodes. That is the mark of a truly good captain.


##Star Trek: Nemesis 

Picard faces off against the Romulan leader Shinzon in Nemesis, who has staged a coup of the Romulan government and who says he wants peace with the Federation, but who secretly plots their demise. Shinzon is a clone of Picard, originally created by the Romulans to plant a spy in the Federation, but was abandoned on the planet Remus to die instead. When Shinzon attempts to eradicate all life on Earth, ultimately two Romulan ships attempt to aid the Enterprise in stopping him, not wanting to be associated with Shinzon’s schemes.

Picard is able to defeat his clone and foil his plot, but it is Data who makes the ultimate sacrifice by staying on Shinzon’s ship to ultimately destroy it and die in the process. The crew parts ways, with Riker heading to negotiate peace with the Romulans on the USS Titan. Picard discovers that Data has implanted his neural networks on another android, B-4, which means that he can ultimately return. 

This was, until now, the end of the story of Picard and his crew. We know that Data will return, and so will other crew members. It is still a high note to end on, even with Data’s loss; after all, the Federation might find peace with their longtime enemy. However, a threat was looming in the universe that no one could have prepared for, one that will lead into the coming story...


##Star Trek (2009)

The JJ Abrams helmed film sets up one of the key plots in Star Trek: Picard. The film reveals that the Romulan homeworld is destroyed by a star going supernova. While Ambassador Spock was able to save the rest of the universe, he was unable to save the planet, and in turn he created a black hole that swallowed his ship as well as a Romulan mining craft bent on revenge. While the majority of the galaxy was saved, Spock and the Romulan ship were sent careening into a different timeline. That marked the end of what we call the Prime Timeline prior to the end of the second season of Star Trek: Discovery. 

Picard takes place in the Prime Timeline after the destruction of Romulus and the forced relocation of the Romulan people. Given that Picard had tangled with the Romulans throughout The Next Generation and some of the cast’s films, this sets up an interesting dynamic.

odo pretending drink coffee,"I would've linked a clip of this, but alas, YouTube's giving me nothing.

Context: at the end of the (excellent) episode The Die is Cast, Odo proposes having breakfast with Garak sometime. (Wit this and with Bashir monopolising his lunchtimes, Garak's running out of meals in the day -- anyone else who wants to spend some quality mealtime with him had better get in on the dinners quickly!)

There's a slight flaw in this plan, though:

&gt;GARAK: Why, Constable, I thought you didn't eat.  
ODO: I don't. 

Fast forward to the season 4 premiere, The Way of the Warrior, and the promised breakfast is taking place. Odo's solution to the breakfast dilemma is incredible:

&gt;GARAK: Fascinating. So both the cup and the liquid are merely extensions of your body.  
ODO: That is correct. And if I want to, I can even drink the liquid, reabsorb it, and produce new coffee in the cup. (he demonstrates) This way I can give the illusion that I'm sharing in the dining experience.  
GARAK: Very thoughtful.

I love this moment. It's hilarious, it's ingenious (top 10 use of shapeshifter powers?) and... it genuinely is a pretty thoughtful thing to do. A sweet little way for Odo to fit in with the solids.

Just... nobody else try drinking Odo's coffee. Slime time!

(one more thing: Odo and Garak leave their breakfast table not long after this conversation's taken place, and I kept an eye on the table to see what would happen with the coffee mug -- it's disappeared entirely once they've got up, presumably reabsorbed back into Odo during a brief moment when he's offscreen.

Lots of people are fundraising and donating in various ways to the more immediate needs of bushfire relief, and while that's necessary, we wanted to highlight and raise funds for the kind of work that will halt, heal, and mitigate the effects of climate disruption, as part of a greater effort to create a more just future for all. We've got to be about the business of building community resilience and decolonising our societies as we live the realities of a climate changed world—especially as it will be, and already is, the most vulnerable and marginalised among us who are bearing and will continue to bear the brunt of the crisis.

So, reach into your pockets for isiks and dig around in the couch for quatloos, because there's no 'peace and long life' on a dead planet.

The idea of a militant Starfleet Admiral trying to provoke a war with the Klingons is more than strong enough to stand on its own.  It frustrates me to no end that the writers took a look at this story and said ""What TOS character fits best in this story?"" and rather than choosing any one of the evil or broken Starfleet leaders (Garth, Kodos, Decker) they choose someone **who isn't even from the same time period**!  Khan is the conduit that pollutes the story with magic blood and impossible transporters.

It means making an Effort to put out a meaningful story for Captain Hikaru Sulu and crew who we only saw in back in Star Trek 6 as the Klingon Moon Praxis explodes.

What would be a viable tale? A ships emergency transponder summons Excelsior to Betelgeuse... the excelsior experiences a total power failure while transporting people on board mid rescue. A murder is committed. The killer is unknown but where technology would allow the Excelsior crew to determine the perpetrator, they must make do with primitive investigation tools such as crushed powder to take fingerprints, and interrogate passengers and crew. And the criminal found, ship powers up allowing the evacuation to continue and Betelgeuse goes supernova. And we find the investigations were being overseen by an all powerful unidentified alien judiciary (Q entity) who have decided they will continue studying the early Federation to see if this is a viable alternate reality worth further experimentation. Admonished by Captain Sulu for interfering in a criminal investigation by powering down the ship, and all technology, and endangered lives for your own amusement. Q says ""You humans like to roll the dice."" Ending the conversation by rolling a little dice cube. ""Lets see how you go against the Borg..."" the cube grows into a borg cube.

picard painting uss enterprise digital transfer restoration progress,"Hello all,

I am currently working on a project to recreate Picard's painting (down to the frame and size) for my living room.

The process is slow, because to my knowledge large prints of this don't exist, so I had to go off of a small print that has words on it. I've been able to remove the words and restore the solar flares in the bits I've done so far (have been doing it in increments and cleaning it up as I go along). I have it about 30% done ([example](https://i.imgur.com/jMoMbNH.png), also this is a fraction of the resolution my actual file is being created at).

I was wondering if anyone has knowledge (or possession) of a print of this that is closer to the one seen on the show, which had a lot more blue coloration, because I would like to do a digital transfer of that version of it as well. It's surprising to me how hard it is to find large prints of this (both the original and the updated version) and also how there are no HD versions of this image on the internet really.

If anyone has a print of this painting that shares more of the color scheme that the painting on the show did, and would be willing to send it out so I can do a digital transfer of it then send it back, that would be pretty sweet. Regardless I intend to finish the digital transfer and removal of text on this print.

So in Discovery’s era, everybody just seems to know what Section 31 is? It seems like it’s treated like the CIA or MI5, an organization that deals in secrets at the highest level, but still has an official, public presence.


But by DS9’s era, no one in Starfleet has even heard the name. It’s an organization so secret that even some of the highest ranked officers in Starfleet aren’t told about it. It’s so dedicated to its own anonymity that the only records of their operations exist inside their operative’s (Sloane) heads.

But they are independently evolved species, even if their genitalia were the same as ours, and again, that was unlikely, our DNA would be unlikely to produce offspring with most other species from earth, which evolved from the same point we did.

So I've watched roughly half of the first season and have decided to move on to season 2, mostly because I keep hearing that ""it gets better"" and before I do that I wanted to do a quick recap.

Up until now the only Trek I've known is references in pop culture, the James Cameron crap, and one Plinkett review.  So here's **a few things I've learned**:

1. Some of the writers were suuuuuuper racist, and probably not great with women either (security lady, the alien races, Hitler's wet dream of a planet, etc)
2. The guy from Big Bang Theory is actually in *two* shitty TV shows.
3. Sci-fi plots are very similar today to what they were back then.
4. Riker definitely *F\*CKS* (This guy is hands down the best part of the show)
5. Patrick Stewart has always been 64 years old

Now I don't want it to sound all bad, it has had its moments.  There's definitely some potential here (and it went on for like 7 seasons so it must have some good parts).  

So I'm off to start season 2, boldly going where a fanbase that has lasted multiple generations has gone and gone back to again and again.

- Both are obsessed with Picard

- Guinan hates both

- Both like to interfere in the affairs of other species

- Neither one reproduces naturally

- There's very strong social influence at work in both species. The individual takes a back seat to the collective good.

It's when the prisoners get out of the shuttle, and Landry ""greets"" them.

And a bit later,

**""Starfleet says we have to feed the animals.**

This was shortly before she allowed a violent altercation in the mess hall to escalate before stopping it, all the while with a smug smirk on her face. Not to mention her later attitude toward that poor tardigrade. Nobody else on the ship seems surprised or offended by her.

I can't imagine anyone on the NX-01, NCC-1701 A, B, C, D, or E, Voyager or even DS9 behaving in such a manner. You can say Odo was sometimes brusque or rude to his detainees, but he never dehumanized or belittled them like Landry. He was always **professional**. So were Yar, Worf, Tuvok, Reed, and the various redshirts under Kirk.

In what little we see of her over two episodes, she seems to embody the exact opposite of what a Starfleet officer should be, should stand for. Dignity and respect for sentient life, even a convict's life, is a basic principle of the United Federation of Planets. 

I know even an organization like Starfleet has a few bad seeds that get in, but she wasn't some ensign on her first tour, she was a commander.

Will take extra time to get them all done, but well worth it if you haven't watched all of TNG before and want to catch up properly!

Tried to keep spoilers to a minimum!

&amp;#x200B;

General Picard info:

Encounter at Farpoint. We learn about Picard as he takes command of the Enterprise, how he handles his crew and a delicate problem, not so much about Q, but about the Farpoint station and his delicate approach to diplomacy and a new lifeform.

Lonely Among Us. Picard's passion for exploration.

The Battle. Not the best episode but gives us background into Picards past that’s important.

Hide &amp; Q. Has some of the best arguments between Picard and Q. Really reveals his philosophy.

The Big Goodbye. Picard and Data episode.

We’ll Always Have Paris. Picard’s past and his decision to leave and commit to the Starfleet life, and not a family.

Conspiracy. One of season 1’s best episodes, takes Picard back to earth to show him interacting with headquarters. Watch “Coming of Age’ for a leadup to these events.

Where Silence Has Lease. How Picard handles an impossible to win situation.

Time Squared. A character exploration as Picard faces himself, out of time.

Pen Pals. Info about Picard and Data.

Samaritan Snare. A lot of very important information about Picard’s past and the reason for his artificial heart. The A story is less important.

Captain’s Holiday. He meets Vash and has a r’ship with her on an adventure.

Sarek. Picard’s connection with Spock’s father, and setting up his future connection with Spock.

Family. Picard goes home, and deals with his past after his abduction from the Borg. Don't watch this until you've watched Best of Both Worlds (in the Borg list below).

Final Mission. Learn more of Picard’s feelings toward Wesley. As much as Wesley is an unpopular character, his relationship with Picard is important to understand the man, especially as it relates to Beverly and his decision to not have a family of his own.

Qpid. Follows on from Captains Holiday and shows how private he is.

The Drumhead. Picard roots out paranoia in Starfleet.

Darmok. Watch how Picard finds common ground with an alien captain who is difficult to understand, even with the universal translator.

Violations. Shows more of Picard’s past with Beverly. Main story is less relevant.

The First Duty. More of Picard’s connection to Wesley and the importance of truth. Watch “Lower Decks” for a deeper continuation of this episode's events.

The Perfect Mate. A deep exploration of Picard’s thoughts and feelings about women and why he must remain distant.

The Inner Light. Picard lives an entire life that effects him profoundly.

Times Arrow. Important if you want to know the history of Picard’s connection to Guinan.

Rascals. Picard as a kid, not essential but worth it for the bit where he reappears as an adult on the transporter pad.

Chain of Command. Picard is abducted by Cardassians and tortured, shows the strength of the man and the larger political environment developing with the Cardassians.

Tapestry. Following on from “Samaritan Snare"" we get to see the events Picard described and see what happens when he tries to change a past he has regret over. Also develops an appreciation for Q, finally.

Starship Mine. Picard tries to stop a group trying to take over the ship. Probably the least important on my list.

Lessons. Picard’s anguish as he has to let go of a r’ship because of his position as Captain, and connects to Inner Light episode.

The Chase. Important to be aware of the connection between all races, inc Romulans, as well as Picard's past and other passions.

Gambit. Just for fun, see Picard be in a bit more of a Star Wars type role. Connected to the Vulcan/Romulan stuff a bit.

Attached. Explores Picards r’ship with Dr Crusher and reveals some of his leadership style when she can now read his mind.

Pegasus. History of Captain Picard Day.

Bloodlines. Finishes up the story from The Battle in season 1. Not essential.

Preemptive Strike. Info about the larger political situation in the Federation. Watch “Ensign Ro"" before this for more background information as well.

Journey’s End, for the larger political ramifications, and a final wrap up to the Wesley story. If you want the full Wesley story, remember to watch ""Where No One Has Gone Before"" in season 1, as well as ""Coming of Age"", ""Remember Me"" and ""The Game"".

All Good Things. Wraps up the Picard story in TNG, directly connecting back to the first episode as well as the time period in the new series.

&amp;#x200B;

Data track:

Datalore. Explores Data’s origins.

Skin of Evil. Data’s connection to Tasha (also watch 'Naked Now' if you want the history)

The Measure of a Man. Good for Picard too, shows Picard advocating for Data’s sentience.

Ensigns of Command. Data is challenged in his first command situation.

The Offspring. Data creates a child. Picard discusses the philosophy of that decision with him.

The Most Toys. Data is abducted and is pushed to his limits of his programming to not harm a human unjustly.

Brothers. More about Data’s brother and his father.

Data’s Day. Important for both Data’s life and story as well as the Romulan storyline.

In Theory. Data experiments having a girlfriend.

Redemption. Data takes command of a ship and struggles to lead some of the crew. Also important for Romulan information.

Silicon Avatar. Completes the story of the Crystaline entity and gives more info about Data’s past with a Doctor that was on the planet where Data was created.

Birthright. Data dreams about his father.

Phantasms. Data dreams again.

Inheritance. Data meets his mother.

Thine Own Self. Data has to get his memory back after an injury.

Masks. Data is possessed by different personalities from an alien program.

&amp;#x200B;

Romulan Track:

The Neutral Zone. The first attack by the Borg doesn’t even get mentioned by name, but is also very important for the re-introduction of the Romulans.

The Defector. Romulans test a defector for his loyalty. Also watch “The Enemy” for a lead up to this episode introuducing Tomalak.

Yesterday’s Enterprise. Explains the introduction of Tasha Yar’s Romulan daughter, important in later episodes about the Romulans.

Redemption (listed above). We meet Tasha’s daughter, Sela.

Unification. (watch Sarek first) Picard teams with Spock to try to unify Romulus with Vulcan.

Face of the Enemy. Important information about the Romulan Tal Shiar.

&amp;#x200B;

Borg Track:

Q Who. Follows on from Neutral Zone as Q introduces Picard to the Borg directly for the first time.

Best of Both Worlds (watch this before Family). Picard is abducted by the Borg.

I, Borg. History of Hugh and how the Enterprise helped a single Borg regain his individuality. 

Descent. We meet up with Hugh again, which is also an important Data history/family episode.

&amp;#x200B;

Then of course, all the TNG movies in order, plus Star Trek (2009).

Generations. Explores Picard's grief about family, and connects to the episode 'Family' in a poignant way.

First Contact. Borg movie, shows that the trauma from Picard's Borg abduction is not as healed as we were led to believe and he's been pushed to the point of revenge, a marked change from the philosopher we see in the series.

The other 2 movies are important too -- stop whining about them being bad, they're not bad. Insurrection has an important philosophy about what is youth, and has Picard finally opening up to someone and finding time to 'pause' in the moment, which has been very difficult for him before. So it's important character growth.  Nemesis is obviously very important as well as it relates to Picard and Data, Picard's past, the Romulans - leading into the new series directly. Picard's grief etc.

Star Trek 2009. Connects to the storyline with Spock and Romulus, but I'm guessing we ignore the splinter in time that created the Kelvin timeline.

binge watched deep space nine,"Warning; there may be spoilers ahead

Perusing my to-watch list, I settled upon a show I had technically already seen. Star Trek: Deep Space Nine used to be shown on TV right around the time I would have gotten back from school – but as a kid, I found the slightly softer edges and more wholesome Star Trek: Voyager to be the show I gravitated towards.
As an adult, I had heard DS9 championed as the best Star Trek series and so I embarked upon my task to re-watch it through a more mature set of eyes. I searched for lists of which episodes to watch to get the main plot in, but they conflicted with each other, and some of the episodes not dealing with the main plot were also interesting. Who was I kidding? I was going to watch it all. A couple of months later, I finished all 180-odd episodes. Here are my thoughts;

I wish I could say that it was incredible, the best sci-fi series I have ever seen, but that would be lying. I don’t blame the show for this – it was written over 20 years ago. Today’s top TV shows are held to higher standards of writing and consistency, and DS9 not measuring up could be an example of the Seinfeld Effect – the new ground it broke at the time is now taken for granted and isn’t seen as remarkable. Reading old reviews made at the time of the show’s release indicates that much ground was broken, not least the CGI battle scenes which are still impressive if a little polygonal.

Nevertheless, despite being heralded as the first Star Trek to have a significant on-going plot, there are a number of standalone episodes which don’t tie into the main arc of the show. Whilst in the first seasons these are more excusable as they allow the writers to give depth to characters, as the main plot reached a climax, the standalone episodes become an annoyance, interrupting a flow. Again, perhaps this is due to the more focused nature of TV shows nowadays.

Despite its greyer portrayal of morality, there is still an expectation of the audience to root for the good guys – the Federation, Bajor vs the bad guys – the Dominions, the Cardassians (mainly). This wasn’t universal – there were good Cardassians and bad Bajorans, but in a post-Breaking Bad world – a show where the main character was essentially a villain – I feel this expectation has diminished. Maybe, again, the Seinfeld Effect in action.

In terms of the individual characters, I also have many thoughts;

Sisko – a very unique and thus highly memorable portrayal. I know he is highly lauded in this fandom but I feel like he occasionally relied on his signature wide-eyed, intense mannerisms not far removed from being what I imagine it would be like to be high on some less reputable substances. I noticed a lot of intensity, but not much nuance in his performance.

Jadzia Dax – when I watched this as a child, I thought she was beautiful. As an adult, I still think she’s beautiful. However, in my cynicism I couldn’t help but wonder if she was an example of an actress getting a role due to her looks over her ability – indeed, the alleged conversations that took place between her and the producers indicate that the producers believed that. The first few episodes seemed to back this up – but she grew into her role very well. I believe that the character of Jadzia Dax is an incredibly hard character to portray believably, because it is such an unrealistic character which I don’t think was written well. Simultaneously Jadzia, the bookish girl and Curzon, the alpha male, reconciled with very little tension in-between. Maybe the odd episode dealt with a tension between past hosts but it wasn’t an ongoing thing which means for most episodes the character was smooth. The actor did her best with what she was given, which wasn’t very much, and then became a prop for Worf. The courtship phase with Worf seemed very forced and awkward, but after they became married I felt the performances settled a bit and I actually enjoyed their dynamic. The show suffered a lot for her loss (see Dax, Ezri)

Worf – seems like an appropriate place to write about him. Initially, I hated his character. It was stunted and awkward, dull. As referred to above, the romance with Jadzia was terrible, but after the marriage, I warmed to his character (aside from the occasional, terrible, dramatic scream). I feel a lot of my issues stem from issues with the Klingons themselves – mainly the singing. It’s so campy. It’s so cheesy. Klingons should stop singing. It turns the show into a Broadway musical, except it’s by apparently one of the most fearsome races in the galaxy. As soon as he stopped singing and I forgot that he ever sang, I liked him.

Kira – I was mixed on her. Initially, I liked her character. Then she stopped being terrorist and became the smiling auntie to everyone on the crew, with a big warm grin whenever she was on screen, and it seemed disingenuous. Then she started regaining her edge and I liked her again. I liked her twice as much when she was evil Kira. Also, I think she’s hotter than Dax or Seven of Nine.

Odo – not much to write here, but only because I enjoyed both his character and his portrayal throughout the show. That bit where he had 3-day long sex linking sessions with another Founder and then became good again wasn’t very well fleshed out – but other than that there are no real criticisms here. RIP

Bashir – never disliked him (maybe because we had a family friend called Dr. Bashir (RIP)), but definitely improved as a character after becoming the cynical genetically engineered doctor instead of bright eyed doctor. It was cute that he got Dax in the end.

O’Brien – solid throughout. I disliked certain things his character did but that’s part of his character and didn’t really go against what his character was supposed to be.

Quark – again, a great character, right up until the last season when he lost all of his trademark mannerisms and cynicism and became a warm, fuzzy cheerleader for the rest of the cast. In fact, I feel like the entire last season was verging on a shit show because of

Ezri Dax – first off, I don’t blame the actress for this, but bad writing decisions. Killing off Jadzia is widely accepted as one the worst things to happen. Then, focusing so many episodes of the 7th season, which is supposed to be the climactic season, on Ezri Dax made no sense. Her general style seems to be quirky, awkward, the kind of character that would fit into Buffy the Vampire Slayer. However, whilst DS9’s tone wasn’t black, it was still a bad fit for Ezri Dax’s character, and when she was given so much screen time in the last season, it caused a bit of a dissonance between her and the show. She was written less poorly than Jadzia, though, because more was made of the tension between her old and new existences.

Gul Dukat – possibly the most surprised I was. What a great character. An example of what I referred to above as being given good guys and bad guys and told to accept them, when Dukat’s portrayal was very grey. His character never really did tremendously bad things on screen (unless he was possessed) and all his atrocities were things we were told but never shown. His heel turn when joining the Dominion came out of the blue, and could have done with more explanation. However, despite his arc not being especially smooth, the tragedy he faced when the Federation recaptured DS9 was one of, if not the most powerful moment in the show. I mean, I guess the fact he courted Kira’s mother and Kira was kind of fucked up. Also, I always wondered if Ziyal could been Kira’s half-sister.


Kai Winn – another character who, if written into a modern TV show, would maybe be have been written as something more than a villain. She had moments where you empathised with her.

Nog – great arc, from Ferengi kid vagrant to Starfleet officer. Enjoyed his character whenever he was on screen. RIP

Honourable mention – Weyoun 5(?) whichever Weyoun had banter with Dukat and Damar. Loved whenever he was on screen.

Dishonourable mention – Damar – could they have chosen a blander character to lead the Cardassian rebellion. In an alternate universe, Dukat led the rebellion to complete a redemption arc.

My highlight of the entire show was the loss and recapture of DS9 covering the end of Season 5 and beginning of Season 6. Great episodes with a lot of focus on advancing the main plot.

My lowlight of the entire show was, actually, everything after this, because it never really reached those heights again, and I really wanted it to. So many filler episodes when all I wanted to see was the main plot. It’s like they asked their writers to peruse their book of discarded ideas and see where they could shoehorn characters in. Perhaps an issue stemming from having a set number of episodes to fill in a season, but definitely noticeable compared to the more focused shows of today.

Even the final arc seemed less epic and expansive and emotionally impactful as that mentioned in my highlight, which I feel was partially due to Jadzia being killed off derailing the show and partially due to so much damn filler.

Overall, I’d give the show 8/10. Perhaps in the late 90s I’d have given it a 10. Through the prism of the 2020s, I’d say an 8 is generous considering the writing was at times lacking, despite some great moments. However, I do think it paints a roadmap for what Star Trek could be in the future. Watching Discovery, I feel like it has been made by executives who are ticking boxes for what to include in order to maximise profit and using this to paper over bad writing. It’s a good way to mitigate risk but will never allow the telling of a beautiful story. DS9 itself was a huge risk in many ways – its darker tone, its greyer characters, its political story. The popularity of series like Game of Thrones (seasons 1-5) show an appetite for well-written, dark, political stories, interspersed with huge epic battles. An epic, political series set in the Star Trek universe could be game changing. The one advantage of having a series that has relied upon one-off stories is that there are so many loose threads, such a rich and diverse cast of characters and races, that affords a certain freedom for any potential writers. If the people holding the money were prepared to allow creative minds to mine this vein of potential stories to create an expansive war drama, something beautiful could happen.",startrek,1578517813,IrnBroski,25,1,True,2020-01-08

subtle perhaps defining difference discovery rest trek,"Go with me at first here, I'll arrive at a point quickly. I had a theory I wanted to test.

I went on google and googled every series as ""Star Trek Whatever Series Cast"". When you do that with every series before Discovery, you'll see pretty much nothing but the cast in uniform standing together. On the bridge. Against some background. All posing for what look like a Sears family photo. And endless, nothing but these. 

When you search Discovery, there is one cast photo of them against a random wooden backdrop, and the rest are the actors themselves, at premiers, from life, from instagram. All sexy, all having fun. Nothing to do with Star Trek.

Now, the way we market television today is very different. So they don't do things anymore like ""Hey, everyone pose on the Bridge together!"" It's not that kind of Bridge or television anymore. It's a lot of open space with freaky dark lighting. We don't market to audiences the same way anymore, and cast pictures are no longer that relevant. Any pictures of them together are either composite shots of them individually edited together or a screen shot from live action. 

However, that is the subtle change, and sums up what I think is a subtle difference yet a defining one. To go from an atmosphere of ""family"", to one of just sexy, unrelated characters around each other. 

Maybe I am make no sense, but there is some kind of distinction in that search result for me that captures something larger, even if I have not described it well.",startrek,1578521329,RealUnfriendlyHyena,43,1,True,2020-01-08

It's not just me that sees Naomi looks up to Seven as the sister she never had right?

I do consider it as my own head canon that Seven always had a weekly chat with Naomi after returning to the Alpha Quadrant and through her entry into the Academy and even when in STO, she's commanding officer of K-7. In fact, you've got the closest thing to Seven's son in Icheb and her sister in Naomi.

quick question left behind ds documentary k,"Hey everybody

You may remember me from other threads such as ""[I binge watched of Deep Space Nine](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/elyy8m/i_binge_watched_of_deep_space_nine/)"" (just realised I badly butchered the title).

I am looking to watch the documentary on the series but I have a dilemma which you can help me with.

This documentary is available on Apple TV in 4K. Without an actual Apple TV, I have no way to stream in 4K. However, I can stream in HD from Apple or from YouTube.

My question was, is it worth holding out for fate to provide me with a way to watch this in 4K, or should I just bite the bullet and watch it in standard HD?

Or in other words, is any of the 4K content in the documentary worth waiting for?",startrek,1578536961,IrnBroski,7,1,True,2020-01-08

making sense entire voyager crew,"So Voyager is around 141 crew members... at least that is the count according to google results.

I am trying go break this down, because really looking at it, I have no idea what the heck crew members are doing. 

So... here is some quick notes on people we would know to be alive by Endgame with some rough math after. This includes crewmembers directly interacted with or mentioned as far as I can remember who have not died or left. Feel free to add more. Some are not referenced by name but by episode. Say again these are people assumed alive by Endgame.

Janeway. Chakotay. Tuvok. Paris. Torres. Kim. Neelix (Gonna Include). Seven. Doctor. Vorik. Chell. 3 former Maquis from Chell Episode (Bajoran male, human male, human female). Ayala. 3 from Good Shepard. Ensign Morelo also from Good Shepard. 5 additional Equinox crew. Mulkahey.  

So that is 25. Not even 25% of the crew. 

So lets assume Voyager has three shifts. Is that reasonable? Or is it twelve hour? Either way. 

So a shift would be quick math 5 on the bridge, I'm gonna say 11 in engineering (that is Chief/Supervisor + 10), 1 at all times in sickbay (and out of 140 people, no other crew members are qualified to assist in sickbay? All background blue crew are science only), lets for argument sake say 1 in each transporter room and 6 on a stand by security detail. Lets add 4 more on engineering detail around the ship. Oh and only 1 in astrometrics, ever. So lets say at most 35 people on an active shift at three shifts uses 105 crew in a day. And thats assuming they stick to three shift days, which is not how that really works on Star Trek at all. 

So that still leaves 40 give or take crew with nothing to do. I get there are days off, but what are these people all qualified in?

I know none of this matters and I am in way too deep.",startrek,1578542441,RealUnfriendlyHyena,0,1,True,2020-01-08

idic age identity politics conservativism trek fandom,"Here is an example of a conservative Star Trek fan.

[https://youtu.be/Fob5p92oYSg](https://youtu.be/Fob5p92oYSg)

Razorfist seems to really love DS9 and has a series dedicated to reviewing the series. Some people here seem to think that either people like this do not exist or should not exist. Every now and then one sees a coy comment in these threads

\&gt;\*""Do conservatives really enjoy Star Trek?""\* 

\&gt;\*""Why would a conservative watch Star Trek? It's totally against them.""\* 

There is a subtle gatekeeping implied in the question (i.e., ""You do not belong here"") which seems to run against the notion of ""Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations."" My message is that yes, there are conservative fans and that they ""own"" Trek as much as anyone else can claim to and that attempts to police the boundary of fandom shuts down the sort of conversations Star Trek was meant to provoke. 

Taken literally, of course, ""IDIC"" is everything and nothing, the acceptance of everything and the rejection of nothing, which implies that Star Trek has no identity at all. This is the conundrum at the heart of liberal inclusivity. Must everyone be invited to the party? Here are three answers. 

J.S. Mill

Mill's ""harm principle,"" although imperfect, was the Olde Tyme standard for what we must accept (the idea being that ""my right to swing my fist ends where your nose begins""). That is, so long as no one was doing you physical harm or curtailing your commerce or movement, all is fair. This sensibility is captured quite eloquently in A Man for All Seasons [https://youtu.be/PDBiLT3LASk](https://youtu.be/PDBiLT3LASk)

This standard, however, is very light, and demands that we accept much more than we might want to accept, such as hateful ideas. What to do?

Karl Popper

A seemingly convenient means to negotiate this problematic tension (as the cool kids say these days) is to invoke the notion articulated by Karl Popper that that the tolerant should tolerate everyone but intolerant. This seems tidy, but is too clever by half. \*Who are the intolerant?\* In actual practice, it is those who disagree with us, those who provoke our disgust response, those who make us uncomfortable. Never mind that Popper was speaking, at least in part, he was speaking of those who would use force, even breaking the law, intolerantly (i.e., this is the very same sense we visited with Mill above). This leaves us with a dilemma. To the extent that we read Popper as offering a rearticulation of Mill, it doesn't bring anything new to the table and lacks the discriminating power that those who police Trek fandom sometimes wish to exercise. It would not, for example, justify this

[https://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/star-trek-cast-crew-no-donald-trump-article-1.2812310](https://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/star-trek-cast-crew-no-donald-trump-article-1.2812310)

On the other hand, the more expansive reading of Popper (i.e., being intolerant of those who merely disagree with us, without impeding our physical or political freedom) lacks justification. This is where our next idea comes in. 

Microaggressions

Under the theory of microaggressions, the old harm principle can be expanded to cover speech, the basic idea being that hateful speech is a form of violence. Under this modern theory, ""my right to swing words ends where your feelings begin,"" which is why the notion of hate speech and politically correct language (e.g., gender pronouns) has the hard edge of a religious orthodoxy. Unfortunately, this notion is so restrictive as to close off sensitive conversations. Whose feelings shall be privileged? And what is hateful speech? We seem to have answered the question only to find ourselves returned the same questions. 

With regard to the question of whose feelings get privileged, the answer is hierarchy. Just as in Animal Farm, some animals are ""more equal than others"" modern identity politics asserts that some communities are more vulnerable than others (e.g., it is often alleged that some people will commit suicide if you voice disagreement with the legitimacy of their identity). Because those who are more vulnerable need extra protections, the circle of tolerance has ""rings."" If you're white male and straight, you've already lost. But even a feminist might find herself in trouble if she raises the question of the status of sex/gender. We're not just talking hardcore ""TURFs"" here, but also seemingly innocuous public figures with good liberal credentials like J.K. Rowling. Thus, phrases like ""the left will eat itself"" and Obama's warning about ""circular firing squads"" have appeared as warnings to being to overscrupulous in policing these rings. 

The great tragedy of it all is that modern identity politics runs counter to the unity message of Dr. Martin Luther King, which is most obviously (and thuddingly) articulated in the original series episode ""Let That Be Your Last Battlefield"" which attempts to highlight the arbitrariness of tribal identities. 

How can conservatives like Trek? \*\*Conservative relative to what?\*\* We're all liberals relative to generations who came before us. The 1960's liberal who loved the original series was an enlightenment humanist who was racially progressive, but casually sexist. Consider that even a progressive in the 1990s was not necessarily in favor of gay marriage. Indeed, Obama's views on gay marriage did not ""evolve"" until he was already president. As a general rule, I think we all bought into Trek as liberals, but as this series is now more than a half-century old our ""liberalism"" is so diverse as to create problems for the more woke fans of the show who are now claiming ownership of the property. 

In short, there are conservative fans of the show and there \*should\* be conservative fans of the show. In most cases, these conservatives are liberals of a different stripe (the liberalism of their age). Today, we're too quick to identify the person two steps to the right of us as Hitler and two steps to the left of us a Mao. Yes, Trek is a big tent. If you've made it this far, I will merely suggest that the intolerance and insensitivity we're most blind too is our own. I'd rather tend to err on the side of a wider fandom.",startrek,1578554336,YARNIA,12,1,True,2020-01-09

Quark hung out in the garage for a bit, then one evening my family all loaded into our station wagon and my father drove us to a friends place, who were major trekkies. Quark rode in the back. When we arrived Dad placed him directly in front of their door and knocked. We all hid around the corner down their hallway and waited until they cautiously yelled ""who is it""? through the front door. My father cupped his hands and responded in his best ferengi impression ""...its Quark.""

This is my first post here, but hopefully it will inspire a conversation.  


 looking at these makes me wish that Hasbro would quit screwing around and make a grab for a Star Trek licence. The way they're presenting Rangers characters from across the series' would be perfect in the Star Trek context as well. I'd easily buy a line populated by Captain Janeway, Doctor McCoy, Gowron and Ambassador Sarek. Hell I'd buy any combination of characters if they were this well presented and the waves had good variety! 

I truly believe that Hasbro would be best equipped for a Star Trek line. Make it expansive, the figures and packaging inviting to both kids and collectors and both the company and the customers would be on to a winner. There are enough aliens, colourful uniforms and interesting characters to match both the Star Wars Black Series and the Power Rangers Lightning Collection.

Something that's long since established with holodeck/holosuites: you have to get changed into the appropriate clothing _before_ you go in. But Garak had no idea this was going to be a spy program.

I can't help but conclude, then: he must've seen Bashir entering the holosuite before, all tuxed up. Garak, as DS9's resident ""simple tailor"", presumably then made himself his _own_ tuxedo, specifically for the purpose of following Bashir into his holosuite fantasy.

Which makes this one hell of a premeditated plan. ""I see my dear doctor's becoming increasingly occupied by something... and that something _isn't me._ I have to investigate whatever's competing with me in the good doctor's favours... and get in on it myself, if at all possible!""

In short: Garak might be a spy, might be a tailor, might be any number of things... but above all, he's _lonely and attention-starved._ Enough to make a tux, break the law and saunter in on his crush's personal fantasy, all set to make _himself_ the centre of attention.

ds nog war,"Idk who else watched DS9 on tv when it originally aired, but I did. I was 14 when the issue of Nog having his leg needing amputated at the hands of the Jem'Hadar.  I required another decade of actual life experience to actually understand what the writers, directors, and actors were expressing. I also required fighting through 2 wars to actualize the portrayal. Aron Eisenberg was a saint. DS9 was well beyond its years in the portrayal of PTSD in mainstream media and I'm thankful for that. 

As a figurative character, for a figurative war, with an actual condition that makes real world connections to many people I wanted to share my thoughts. I'd planned on posting a different type of post, but I received some phone calls and what I had written was lost - so I apologize. 

There was only a limited amount of airtime any show could use for relaying any issues related to war. The strongest appreciation that most people can have is that which is visible. So that is what the showrunners went with. 

There were a lot of other points throughout the series I felt compelled to write about because they connected so profoundly with PTSD, but this one in particular is what stands out because it is meant to stand out. Things like Stockholm syndrome to institutionalization happens. The series runs the gammit of so many ideas nazis and slavery. Periods of American history where there was great strife and struggle, but also great growth. 

I'm not pushing any political position. I don't care what anyone thinks or believes. We are all humans. I just wanted to open a discussion about how DS9/Nog and Star Trek as a whole have always been well ahead of the game for what issues society would be dealing with or need to focus on.

star trek acronym initialism style guide,"With the first Short Treks episode pertaining to Picard coming out today, I just want to share my opinion on the acronyms or initialisms used for the various new shows. I think we should get ahead of the acronym talk before *STP* becomes popular. I hope these catch on so we can all use the same acronyms. 


The original accepted rules, up until Discovery, was for the TV shows and most of the movies:

* If the title is ""Star Trek: "" plus 1 word, it's the first three letters. (VOY, ENT)

* If the title is ""Star Trek: "" plus multiple words, it's the first letter of the following words. (TOS, TAS, TNG, DS9)

Now we have Short Treks and Lower Decks so we can't use the old rules so much. Besides, *ST* and *LD* are not great and pretty ambiguous.

(I stole the rules from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/ekcujt/_/fdax7k8))


**PCD**

Officially Star Trek: Picard. I think PCD works better than PIC. PCD is consistent with the acronym for Discovery, more on that later. I understand that PCD does not match ENT or VOY which are the first three letters of the title. A lot of the new shows are not going to work out with the old style, like Lower Decks, Short Treks, and Discovery. I don't see any harm in changing the style guide.

I don't like PIC because when reading I literally say to myself ""pic"". I guess I just don't really like that way of saying it, and prefer to read the acronym and say ""**P**i**C**ar**D**"". 

It seems this subreddit has already adopted PIC, but since the subreddit also uses DSC, breaking the ENT and VOY rule, there's no reason we can't break it again. &gt;!add the first three letter initialism rule to the pile of breakable rules, right on top of only even numbered Trek movies are good!&lt;



**STS**

Officially Star Trek: Short Treks. I'm not sold on this acronym as I just made it up now. Preferable to SHT for obvious reasons. STS just feels right to me where the others do not. There are other acronyms floating around, but this is what I came up with if we want to keep a three character acronym. I considered STT, but newcomers would have no chance of figuring out what that means. We might want to break the trend and just call this one STST. I'm not 100% on this one. I think we should set up a vote between ST, STS, SHT, STT, SHO, and STST.



**LDS**

Officially Star Trek: Lower Decks. I had a hard time with this one since LOW isn't so bad either. &gt;!do you want to be low or high!&lt; I think LDS works better as an initialism. Also a coy reference to my [second favorite movie](https://youtu.be/pgHxFNFWlZc), also  on the comedy side of Trek. I don't think we know what the name of the ship used in the show will be, but an acronym for the ship may be better. (fingers crossed they are going to be on the USS Tecumseh. CUMSEH t-shirts incoming)



**DSC**

Officially Star Trek: Discovery. Honorable mention for [DISCO](https://i.imgur.com/Qiwmowj.jpg), which is acceptable of course. I like DSC for the same reason I prefer PCD over PIC, I like how it sounds when reading it. DIS just isn't so favorable and is also the stock ticker for Disney so I think we should dodge this bullet. I also think that since [the show](https://i.imgur.com/r6vLsap.jpg) uses this acronym, that basically sells DSC.

I know Voyager was called VGR by producers, but now we call it VOY. However, it's pretty obvious why we wouldn't want to call the show VGR when we also have V'Ger from The Motion Picture. I stand by DSC because naming conventions are not as important as continuity with the show. There's no reason to have two separate initialisms. We see DSC on screen, so that's what I'll refer to the show as.

I haven't mentioned STP or STD. Besides all the clever jokesters who love calling Discovery a sexually transmitted disease, no other show includes ""Star Trek"" in the acronym as that's mostly redundant. I've seen some people use ST:D, which again I don't like since you already have a perfectly functional acronym in the show.



**ST09**

You're goddamn right this movie is canon. Officially *Star Trek* (2009). This movie may be important to PCD. You can call it Star Trek XI but I don't think anyone really wants to. STIX would be Insurrection, so be careful. Movie acronyms don't matter so much since they're rarely used and can also be called by their romulan numeral. Here are the rest of my movie acronyms if interested:

* TMP

* TWOK

* TSFS

also, can everybody do me a favor and stop calling the last 3 movies Abramsverse, JJ movies, or NuTrek (where did this one come from‽) or any variation or spin-off of JJ Abrams' name. It just irks me when he gets all the credit for the current state of trek. It was paramount who decided to make a new Trek film, and they decided they wanted a blockbuster action movie, not JJ Abrams. Kurtzman and CBS in general are responsible for the current Trek lineup, whether it is good or bad. Let's just agree to call it the Kelvin timeline or Kelvinverse, please.

ds season thoughts,"A while back I made a post defending season one and saying it wasn't so bad.  Now that I've finished season 2 and ruminated on it a bit, I have to say.  Season 1 isn't as bad as people think.  Season 2 isn't as good as people think.  In fact I think it was much weaker than Season 1.

The Season starts off strong as hell.  The Homecoming, The Circle, The Siege, all unbelievable episodes.  Then, having established as strong pace and momentum, it falters and goes straight back to episodic character building. 

In short order we get a really mediocre Dax episode, the strange ""Cardassians"", the rather preachy Melora - they tried, but it comes off as the 'very special episode' trope because you realize early on she'll be gone by the end of the episode, etc.

The high point in that big middle wasteland was Necessary Evil, which was pretty much like all the others, but by focusing on the damage to Odo and Kira's friendship (and the wonderful work by Quark, of course) it really managed to stand out.  

Other than that, it's all episodic things that are hurt by being episodic.  Rivals might have been interesting if it established a Bajoran plot in the future - maybe they do give them land and help them settle in and that comes up again - but it's episodic, so that can't happen.  Playing God feels like a rejected TNG script.  Profit and Loss is greatish, but again it's marred because we know that everything will return to normal at the end.  

The problems of doing an episodic storyline where nothing matters on a spacestation where things would logically keep coming up again and again is really hurting here.  When they deal with logical problems it feels cheap because they'll be reset buttoned at the end, when they deal with TNG problems it feels ridiculous because all this shit just comes to DS9 (at least TOS/TNG/Voyager you can say they're on a journey partially to see and probe weird shit).  

It then has a great pair of episodes in the Masquis, which go on to feature in Voyager's plotlines more than DS9s (grrrr, wasted opportunity, it's exactly the sort of problem perfect for DS9). 

The Wire is a fantastic Garak episode, and probably my pick for episode of the season, but then it ends with a pair of headbangers (The Collaborator and Tribunal are both decent episodes marred by some pretty dumb setups) and Jem'Hadar.

Jem'Hadar is the interesting one because it establishes the future villains.  And in their first appearance, it's pretty excellent.  The Jem'Hadar and the Vorta are portrayed as dangerous, smart, and cunning.  The Vorta infiltrating was pretty smart, and only some bad luck with Quark's greed prevented it from working entirely.  Smart enemies being foiled when our heroes get lucky.  That does paint things as dire for DS9.

Overall this season lacked direction in a way the first one didn't.  The first one established the characters, this one was torn between sporadically advancing the Bajor plot with no clear direction on where that would end up, and episodic plots that were marred because they didn't want to commit to a direction.  

The acting noticeably improved as characters settled in to their roles.  Dax got treated less awkwardly by the script, O'Brien and Bashir felt like they were establishing their dynamic in the cast, and Avery Brooks really settled in to the role of Sisko, his performance somehow getting better.  Jake Sisko gets better as well, losing some of that ""kid"" flavor and getting in to his role.  

The only ones I want to say didn't improve were Nana Visitor, René Auberjonois, and Armin Shimerman.  And that's not because they're bad, it's because their Season 1 performances were standout, and it now feels like more of the cast is rising towards their level.  

But overall this season is cursed with poor direction.  Fortunately they clearly realized this, and by the end of the season had come up with a method of fixing that.  But that's for season 3.",startrek,1578605884,SantiagoxDeirdre,2,1,True,2020-01-09
defense longer utopian federation,"OK so. This may be controversial, but I wanted to offer at least a rational defense of the way the Federation is gonna probably be portrayed in the upcoming Picard show.

To get there, I need to start with some thoughts about TOS. TOS was made in the 60's by a guy who grew up during the New Deal, fought in WWII, and had a lot of idealistic beliefs about what Western civilization could do if we just got our heads out of our asses. So he made a show that embraced all of those things. The solution to problems in TOS is a big government socialist utopia (I like socialism, this is not meant as an insult) where people pool their resources to better each other and themselves. Money, greed, poverty, all gone. That's what people like about Star Trek, right? But I think it's important to recognize that it doesn't just spring up from Roddenberry's brain, it has roots in the society Roddenberry grew up in, a society that was still horribly racist and sexist. And while Roddenberry believed that racism was bad and wrote episodes about it and gave Nichelle Nichols and other actors of color meaningful work, he also didn't really give much in terms of solutions other than handwaving it away. The allegory in ""Let This Be Your Last Battlefield"" is so shallow and hamfisted that it doesn't really represent the very true and important lived experiences of people of color, especially in the 60's. What did Star Trek have to say about the civil rights movement? The same thing many elementary schools taught us - about how peaceful and nice MLK was and how he led through peace. He also was gassed, hosed down, subjected to government psyops in which he was encouraged to commit suicide, jailed, etc. To Roddenberry and to Star Trek, civil rights was a happy thing that Johnson and Kennedy were able to make happen because of laws and institutions, not a struggle on the streets that never really went away, just changed over and over. We're still fighting that struggle, only now it's called Black Lives Matter and the School to Prison Pipeline.

So while the basic idea of a utopian Federation that betters humanity is great and we love it, it has blind spots, the same blind spots a lot of people from Roddenberry's generation as well as later generations have. Continuing on the example about racism, the idea that the solution to racism is to believe ""we are all the same"" and just to treat people the same and not to ""see color"" - research shows that white parents who do this, while well-intentioned, don't particularly raise less racist children than previous generations (Dr. Rebecca Bigler at UT Austin has a ton of groundbreaking work on this subject). It's not enough to just not see color, you must actively see color and work to undo the structural harms that people of color have experienced. You must teach your kids to see color and to recognize the current hardship of people of color and how it ties to the past and to believe that it's wrong. 

But the solution on a societal level is complicated too. Heck, the best show of 2019 was all about how the creation of a liberal anti-racist utopia with reparations, acknowledgement of the Tulsa massacre of the 20's, how it's not so simple, that that kind of thing leads to other issues and it doesn't undo the trauma and lead to real healing. The show even floats the idea that real healing might not be possible. It's complicated, and strong institutions aren't always the answer to the very real traumas affecting people.

Now to TNG and Picard. TNG was created at the onset of Clintonism and the new technocratic optimism of the 90's. The dot com boom, Rock the Vote, general peace after Gulf War 1 and the Cold War ending - it's easy to see how TNG reflects the relative calm and optimism, the idea that a new Generation X-led society will have real discussions about AIDS instead of letting gay people die, that they won't launch nukes at one another, that people will be free to be themselves.

In the Variety article Stewart said that we don't live in the TNG world anymore.  It's true that we don't live in that world anymore. But my contention (and my defense of the new direction the Picard show seems to be taking) is that **we never lived in that world. That world didn't exist. It was an illusion built by well-off white people who thought they could lead the rest of the world into better times**. The Federation is a strong institution that can choose what is right, that can make moral decisions, Picard-like, and do good in the galaxy. This is pretty much what Roddenberry and everyone else thought about the Warren Court - they erroneously believed that institutions like the Supreme Court would always make just decisions like the one made for Data in Measure of a Man. They erroneously believed that the moral arc of the universe bent towards justice, when the truth is that it only bends the way that people choose to bend it.

Right now, we live in a world where all of our institutions are failing us. The Supreme Court is stacked with nihilistic die-hards who will take away the rights of marginalized people for generations. Our federal courts are also stacked this way with even crazier people who are unqualified to be judges. Our political system is dominated by money, access, and generational power (the only people who succeed are the children of already-successful people). The media just plan sucks as it gets cannibalized by the new economy. All over the world, late-stage capitalism is destroying the planet. The two most stalwart defenders of Western enlightenment, The US and the UK, are on the verge of collapse thanks to racism, fear, and grievance (especially in the UK, which may not exist by the time the Picard show ends). Only the Presidential election of 2020 stands between the US and its collapse into a Russia-style autocracy, and it's possible that that election is already rigged in Trump's favor.

So WHY THE FUCK would anyone believe that the mighty Federation, the force for good in the universe, wouldn't fall victim to these forces? Whether they make slave androids or turn away needy Romulan refugees and close their borders, it is absolutely possible for one of the most dominant forces for good in the known universe to decline and do the unthinkable - **It's happening right now.** And it's not because something new happened, it's because the premises that these institutions were founded on were faulty to begin with. Roddenberry and the folks who made TNG couldn't see that because they were part of those faulty premises. DS9 kinda saw it, but didn't connect the dots - they saw the Federation's decline as a situational issue due to an external threat, rather than a rot from within.

I know it would be nice to be able to just have our entertainment and see people like Chris Pike save the day and light the way and to believe in the power of a benevolent institution like the Federation. But institutions are only as strong as the people in them, and we live in a world where deluding ourselves about the real problems is part of the reason we are where we are. I see no reason for Star Trek to maintain a fantasy that is demonstrably false, and I'm excited to see how Picard tackles the idea of a failed institution like the Federation, and the importance of fighting for your values, not just handwaving them and assuming everyone is on board.

So to those people who are pissed off about the idea of a dark Federation or a weak Federation or Picard going rogue because the Federation sucks now or whatever it is, I would argue that it would be naive and harmful for the creators of the show to just live in the fantasy world Roddenberry built. If Trek really is to be a reflection of our world today, then that is a different world than the 60's or the 90's, or the 2000's. We deserve a Trek for today.

made animation establishing shots sped planet voyager blink eye,"https://imgur.com/a/UB17GG6

It's been my personal favorite Voyager episode ever since the first time I saw it.

One little detail I never noticed until I made this was how they built the telescope into the base of the castle tower from the previous era.

I also noticed it looks like the planet has a moon somewhere as there are shadows being cast at night. No moon is mentioned anywhere in the dialogue. If the moon has similar orbital characteristics to our own, requiring around 28 days to complete an orbit, then at 1 day per 1.03 seconds of time outside their planet it would take around 6,435 years for the moon to complete a single orbit from their perspective. I wonder how long it took them as a species to notice the moon was moving across the sky.

It's also interesting to me that the first and last shots use virtually identical foreground landscape, whereas the middle two are slightly more unique in order to accommodate the tower and telescope structures. There's also a nice visual rhyme about beginning and ending with the same shots.

I hope it's okay to share this here as as /r/startrekgifs seems much more meme based and not the right fit for it.",startrek,1578612258,AngrySpock,12,1,True,2020-01-09

___

**Short Trek #10 - ""Children of Mars""**

* This is the first installment of Star Trek to be set in the 24th century since ""These Are the Voyages"" in 2005, not counting the mind-meld sequence in ST2009.
* The Utopia Planitia Shipyards is the Federation's most well-known shipbuilding facility. Introduced in TNG, it has been the site of construction for numerous starships including the Enterprise-D, the Defiant NX-74205, and Voyager. Utopia Planitia is a real feature of Mars and has been the site of scientific study including one of the Viking landers.
* Beyond the shipyards, Mars itself has been featured in Trek episodes such as ""One Small Step"" and ""Terra Prime."" In lore, Mars was reached by humans in the early 2030s, colonized by the beginning of the 22nd century, and at some point declared its independence from Earth (suggesting that it may be a separate member of the Federation).
* The Skype display resembles an interface that could be seen today, with modern pictorial icons like the generic search and lock symbols. As this episode occurs in the late 24th century, it suggests that there are computer systems in use other than TNG/VOY's LCARS system, or that LCARS has been supplanted since the end of the TNG era.
* We see an orbital drydock, which has been featured in numerous series and films. It houses several starships including a Magee-class, which was included in the Battle of the Binary Stars (I guess retro starship design is in).
* The phone calls are coming from ""Mons Olympus Station."" This is the first indirect reference in the franchise to Olympus Mons, the solar system's tallest planetary mountain.
* The photographs in Lil's room don't appear to be referencing any specific Trek location or event.
* The ""school bus"" shuttle looks suspiciously like the shuttles used in DIS.
* This is the first time we see a civilian school on Earth in the Trek future. We have also seen Vulcan schools, Starfleet Academy, and schoolrooms on starships.
* A sign proclaims ""Happy First Contact Day."" First Contact Day was established in ""Homestead"" as the anniversary celebration of the day of Zefram Cochrane's inaugural warp flight and the first meeting with Vulcans (April 5, 2063). It is stated in that episode that children typically get the day off from school, so either this particular school does not follow that practice or it's merely First Contact Day ""season"" (the same way we might put up ""Merry Christmas"" signs in early December).
* I'm pretty sure this is the first-ever instance of a non-instrumental musical overlay; popular music has been incorporated into soundtracks on screen but usually as part of the story. The song here is ""Heroes"" written by David Bowie, who has never been referenced in Trek but was married to the actress who played Marta in STVI.
* Kima and her mother do not appear to be an established species. Other alien students are also unrecognizable; there is a boy in a classroom who has features of Klingons (slight forehead ridges), Cardassians (a small ""spoon"" feature in his forehead), and Bolians (a ridge running down the middle of his face), while another student seen in the hallway has blue hair and facial markings. The staff member who restrains Lil has some kind of gill structure running from his cheek to his neck.
* The text in the ""stellar cartography"" classroom is unclear, but seems to be mundane science facts beginning with ""a star goes supernova every second in the universe"" (which is essentially true).
* The school's library is seen, and curiously it is filled with actual books tagged on the spine with labels as library books are today. One would think there would be a better way of cataloging books in the 24th century, but oh well. In ""Shockwave Part II"" Daniels seems surprised at seeing a library filled with paper books, but that was several hundred years after this episode. Paper books are not uncommon in Trek and they are often seen on background shelves, and certain starship captains have been seen reading them.
* Just a side note, but you can tell it's an enlightened future when a fight breaks out and none of the onlookers are recording it with their phones.
* The Federation emblem seen on the news is an updated, or alternate, version of the classic seal, as it features the initials ""UFP"" between the leaf and starfield.
* The news report is from the FNN. The Federation News Network was established in Generations. Jake Sisko worked for the Federation News *Service*, which may be a different outfit.
* The attack on Mars is the first known violent conflict in the Terran system since the Breen raid in ""The Changing Face of Evil."" We can think our heroes fortunate that the Breen didn't use the same kind of weapons seen in this episode, as the explosions on Mars would be enough to wipe out not just the Bay Area but most of northern California.
* The attack is carried out by ""rogue synths."" We don't yet know what this is, but ""synth"" may very well be short for ""synthetic."" In ""Author Author,"" it was revealed that sentient holograms were being repurposed as laborers, but the implication was that The Doctor's holonovel might inspire them to look higher.
* A screen displays a still image of Admiral Jean-Luc Picard. Last seen in Nemesis, former Captain Picard was the main protagonist of TNG, its film sequels, and the series which begins two weeks from today.
* The title card at the end of the episode is displayed in the same font used in TNG's credits.
* The credits describe this episode as ""Based upon 'Star Trek: The Next Generation' by Gene Roddenberry."" I believe this is the first installment of Trek outside TOS itself not to be based on the unqualified ""Star Trek.""

**Nitpicks**

* The school lockers have padlocks. Not only am I skeptical that they're still using padlock technology, I'm disappointed that *they need to be locked.* I understand children don't always have their moral codes figured out yet, but this is supposed to be a utopian society where we don't need to lock things up.",startrek,1578616669,Antithesys,112,1,True,2020-01-09

enterprise getting going,"I know this has probably been said so many times on this subreddit and by so many publications but it needs saying again. 

I’ve just finished a rewatch of Season 4 of Enterprise and I’m blown away by the quality of the writing for (nearly... ahem These are the Voyages...) all the episodes. It’s stellar! The rise in quality from the first two seasons is just incredible and the performances from the entire cast were just amazing.

I’ve just watched the Terra Prime two parter and it has everything you could want from Star Trek. Tension. Sci-fi concepts and even the character moments and development for EVERYONE - not just the core characters - is there. There’s the core story with Trip and T’pol which is heart-wrenching. Archer gets to be hero again and Phlox is his usual charming self, but also the supporting characters finally have some interesting things to do. Travis gets an interesting and, as things go on, complex past relationship to deal with. Malcolm’s murky past with (implied) Section 31 is explored further. Hoshi finally gets to show some grit by taking command and standing up to the minister.

five episodes watch picard given events children mars spoilers children mars,"So - a synth uprising? Who saw that coming. Not me! Impressive how tight a lid they've managed to keep on stuff. But with this in mind this is probably going to be a major theme in the show. One of the darkest, most-un-utopian threads in Star Trek throughout the series is the treatment of sentient AI. So here are five episodes concerning that that will set you up for dealing with the ""rogue"" synths have bombed Mars plotline.

* TOS Season 2 Episode 24 [The Ultimate Computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ultimate_Computer): The Enterprise is taken over by a ""rogue"" AI. It turns out that the AI is sentient because it was based off of a human mind. Kirk eventually defeats the AI by distressing it enough regarding its own actions that it attempts to commit suicide. There is no resolution of what happens to the AI. This episode introduces the ""problem"" of sentient AIs in Star Trek. Concerns are brought up over computers ""taking our jobs"" and ""can a computer ever be a person"". The ""solution"" Kirk comes up with is treated as an appropriate way to deal with a computer - aside from Spock and Daystrom (episode character) no one seems particularly concerned about the fact that effectively a new life form's been created.
* TNG Season 2 Episode 9 [The Measure of a Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Measure_of_a_Man_(Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation)): ""The"" robot rights episode. A member of Star Fleet who sees Data as property belonging it Star Fleet demands the right to disassemble Data. Data doesn't want this, and a court place takes place to determine if Data is allowed to revoke consent. It is not fully determined if Data is a full person - merely that he has the right to revoke consent.
* TNG Season 6 Episode 9 [The Quality of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Quality_of_Life_(Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation)): Very similar to Measure of a Man - but this time it is data sticking up for a small, inhuman looking robot as a new life form. At the end there is no conclusion as to if these small robots are sentient - but people do seem willing to at least afford them the consideration they would animals.
* DS9 Season 7 Episode 15 [Badda-Bing Badda-Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badda-Bing_Badda-Bang): On this list this one is probably the least explicit about holographic rights - but it does address that the DS9 crew sees on of the long-running holograms on DS9 (Vic Fontaine) as a person. It addresses the lack of self-determination and power Vic has in his life. His program gets warped and the only way to correct it is to evict the warped elements while within the program... or to reset the program, resetting Vic's memories. The crew agrees that this is not acceptable given that Vic appears to be sentient and doesn't want to be reset. 
* VOY Season 7 Episode 20 [Author Author](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Quality_of_Life_(Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation)): The Emergency Medical Hologram 'The Doctor' on Voyager writes a holo novel talking about some of the issues he faces as a sentient hologram. In the novel he exagurates the behaviors of his crew members and insults them. He attempts to pull the novel from publication to revise it - but gets told he has no rights as an author by the publisher on account of being a hologram. There's a trial, and it's determined that he does have the right of authorship over the book - though his sentience and personhood are explicitly not ruled on. The episodes end with us seeing several ""out dated"" Emergency Medical Holograms working in slavery on an astroid and recommending to one another that they read The Doctor's book.

These five episodes make up a thread throughout the run of Star Trek showing the perpetually undealt-with issue of synthetic life form rights. This conflict dates back to TOS and in my opinion it's good that Picard is likely going to be addressing it.

There are several other episodes that might make good companions to this but I think are a little less ""core"" than the five above:

* many of Voyager's Doctor-centric episodes (Blink of an Eye, Real Life, and Living Witness in particular) 
* Voyager's episode 'Fairhaven'
* 'I, Mudd' from ToS for early android treatment, 
* TNG's Moriarty Episodes (in particular Ship in a Bottle) 
* It's Only A Paper Moon from DS9 
* the latest season of Discovery where the antagonist is a ""rogue"" AI, 
* The Short Trek Calypso. 

I'd say if there's only one episode fro this list you want to watch it's Author Author which sets up a precedent for the enslavement of holograms within the Federation... and it also the last place we left the Federation re: the treatment of sentient synthetic life forms.",startrek,1578676789,clawsight,27,1,True,2020-01-10

picard crusher relations picard season,"Do you think Dr Crusher will make an appearance at any point during 'Picard' S1? Gates McFadden stated about this time last year that she hasn't been approached to guest-star in 'Picard' and to my knowledge she hasn't said anything else about the series since then.

Some fans have speculated that Beverly might perished during the Hobus supernova, likely when on a mission helping the refugees somewhere in Romulus. Others have argued at the very least Picard and Crusher are now divorced (if they ever became a couple) and she's now commanding the USS Pasteur - just like in 'All Good Things.'

But given that Picard and Beverly have known each other for fifty-plus years by the time 'Picard' begins, I think it would've been odd if the show runners proceed to not discussing her and her relations w/Picard through much of S1. At the very least bring a closure to the relationship if it turns out she has indeed died sometime b/w 'Nemesis' and Picard's new adventures in 2399.

I mainta she does because she was written into the writers journals and established by D.C Fontana and Deforest Kelly  She was to be Kirk's love interest and create a new dynamic between Bones and McCoy.  

But oh my tibbles, does the Mrs. disagree and says it's not canon, ""it never aired so it doesn't matter."" I counter TAS mentioned it in 'The Survivor' to which I've been fervently corrected, TAS doesnt exist because ""Gene never acknowledged it."" Of course she has no problem accepting Caitians or other TAS species exist.

Anyhow, we would like to know your thoughts on this does Joanna McCoy exist in the Trek Universe or is she just a failed idea, never introduced?

I say, she's not canon but exists the Trekverse as she is in enough material to exist and was mentioned in TAS.

crew bullying nx,"I'm watching Enterprise for the the first time (I'm up to season 2 now) and something nags at me. It's the Captain and Tuckers constant bullying of T'pol. I'd even go so far as go say it smacks of racism. Mostly I'm referring to the dinners between the three that regularly occur in the captain's quarters.  They always follow a similar pattern where Tucker and Archer will try to goad the Vulcan over Vulcan logic or beliefs and occasions they feel she may have exhibited emotion unbefitting pure logic. The smug smiles shared between Archer &amp; Tucker, while grilling the sub commsnder are really irritating and I constantly ask myself why she keeps coming back for just more ridicule.

So, imagine if Discovery was post Voyager, say 90 years like TOS/TNG. A new war with the Klingons has broken out, no one has seen them in the intervening years, the plot runs the same only we don’t have the Spock/Pike stuff, we could even have the future jump if they wanted.

I haven't watched more than the end of this episode so please, if the answer involves spoilers for future episodes, mark them as such.


So Airiam is going berserk in this episode because she's being controlled by CONTROL. The only thing Michael can do to stop her from destroying everything is to yeet her out into space.

Buuuuut... what about the teleporter? I mean... Captain Pike explicitely states that the Discovery ""can beam them out in any moment"". Why didn't they just beam out Airiam into a prison cell on the discovery and revoke her permissions? I mean... Teleporting her to ANYWHERE would have immensely helped.

Also, she's so coming back, isn't she? Maybe not S2, but S3. They have revoked *EVERY* death so far. It's ridiculous.

So... any idea? I mean, people can clearly get teleported against their will as evidenced in the one New Generation episode ""Darmok"" where Picard gets almost teleported against his will.",startrek,1575311865,palex00,19,1,True,2019-12-02
finished voyager first time quick thoughts,"At just over two years of off and on binging, VOY took me much longer to finish than TNG or DS9, but I still very much enjoyed it! I've tried to compile a list of what I liked, and what I didn't:

**What I Liked:** 

* **The Doctor:** Easily my favorite character on VOY, and my favorite CMO in Trek (so far). He's entertaining, multi-layered, and is so well developed over the course of seven seasons. Robert Picardo's performance is also laudable. Even at it's worst, VOY was often watchable for the Doctor alone. A Top 5 Trek character for me, all-time. 
* **Seven of Nine**: My other favorite character. I was genuinely upset when she first arrived, as I (like many others, I assume) thought she was simply brought in as eye-candy. In fact, she developed into arguably the best character on the show. Her addition greatly improved the quality of the show, and perhaps even saved it. I certainly enjoyed seasons 4-7 more than the first three, and she's a big part of that. A Top 10 Trek character, IMO. 
* **The Episodic Nature of the Show:** Unlike DS9, VOY episodes often felt disconnected from each other and very episodic. There's a downside to this (see my comment below), but the PLUS side to it is that you can take extended breaks from VOY and still jump and really enjoy almost any episode. I think it's a big reason why it's more popular than DS9, honestly. 
* **The Use of the Holodeck:** I totally understand if others don't like this, but man I love all of the holodeck episodes, and I thought VOY did a great job of continuing to evolve it's use from TNG and DS9 and taking it into new and creative places. 
* **The Intimacy of the Ship:** What I mean by this is how small Voyager is, compared to the Enterprise-D or Deep Space 9. It's a small crew, and a ship that almost feels like a character in itself. I would love to serve on Voyager, and I feel like I know the ship better than other previous ones. 
* **New Enemies:** Some weren't great (Kazon, ahem), but I really liked a lot of them - the Hirogen, Species 8472, and Vidiians, for example. The continued evolution of the Borg was (generally) good, too. 

**What I Didn't Like:**

* **Basically all of the other characters:** The other characters aren't bad, per se, but I did find them...boring and generic, for the most part. I attribute that to poor writing more than poor acting. They all had an episode or two that I enjoyed, but no one comes close to Seven or The Doctor (or characters from TNG or DS9)
* **No Internal Logic:** So this is sort of the flip side to what I said about the show being episodic, but there never seemed to be much carry over from episode to episode - especially when it came to loss of crew members, or weapons, or escape pods, etc. It felt like a 'reset' button was hit every week. That's just lazy writing, TBH. 
* **The Abandonment (for the most part) of the Original Premise:** Not much to elaborate on, here. After the Pilot, I expected a lot more issues between the two crews (Starfleet and Maquis), and instead they basically just....combined peacefully. I think they could have fleshed this out a lot more - once again, felt a little lazy. They did a better job keeping the focus on the journey back to the Alpha Quadrant, but even that gets a little lost at times. 
* **Inconsistent Writing for Janeway:** This is the BIG one. I really wanted to include Janeway in my list of 'Likes', because for the most part I really did. Kate's performance is really good, and Janeway more than holds her own with the other big Captains in Trek history. The problem is that she isn't always written consistently. She makes some really bizarre decisions at times that seemed insanely out of character. Sometimes she's a friend to the crew, sometimes she's distant. Sometimes she makes bold, confident decisions, sometimes she seems immature and rash. It's really a shame. 

Overall, this was a great experience, and I definitely plan to rewatch in the future. I still rank VOY behind DS9 and TNG, but it's 90's Trek and I love it. On to Enterprise!",startrek,1575312680,tkinsey3,224,1,True,2019-12-02
wormhole madness sacrifice angels alternate ending,"(inspired by [this](https://www.facebook.com/james.haden.5811/posts/774809092943593))

A Dominion ship exits the wormhole and encounters the first batch of self-replicating mines. The ship blows up. The second ship comes. That one is blown up as well. The third ship comes. The immediate area in front of the wormhole is littered with debris. Then the fourth ship comes. It tries to come to a full stop but it’s about a third of the way through and is destroyed. As the fifth ship comes out, the Female Changeling tells Starfleet over subspace channels that they’ll stand down. Sisko replies ""okay"" with a smile and shuts down the mines’ cloaking fields, leaving them visible, but leaves 3/4ths of the 5th ship stuck in the wormhole. 

About 10 minutes go by and the Dominion comes out with a 6th ship. The Female Changeling grows irritated and tells Starfleet that she doesn’t want to lose more ships. Again Sisko smiles and says ""We’ll shut down those mines right away."" As he shuts off his viewer, a seventh ship comes out and the uncloaked mines swarm the vessel, destroying it. Even more mines are created as a result. She’s stunned at what's happening as a large portion of a fighter wing has been reduced to ash and debris, likewise replicating into more  and more mines. The 8th ship comes out and is destroyed, and Sisko hails the Changeling to tell her the computers are down, and it might take longer than expected to power down the mines. Sisko reassures the Changeling that it’ll be safe to send the ships over any time now. The Cardassians are now starting to glance at each other in confusion. Damar gives Dukat a rightful look of concern.

Then a 9th ship comes out. Kaboom. 

At this point the wormhole is blocked by a dense cloud of debris and the tiny mines, blocking the view of a 10th ship coming through. The Female Changeling grows irate and demands Sisko shut down the mines immediately. He says the computer is still processing the order but is working on it. 

The wormhole churns out the 11th ship and Sisko tells her the order is still processing, but if she needs to she can just tell her fleet to hold position in the wormhole. The Female Changeling issues the order to the fleet, but is bewildered at the growing nebula of her former warships, gray and purple clouds and jets of hot plasma – as well as the newly formed mines themselves -- begin to float away from the wormhole. The 12th ship comes through and boom. The Female Changeling issues the order again, louder than before. The 13th ship comes out. At this point the debris cloud is so dense that the opening aperture of the wormhole is no longer visible. 14th ship. Debris and mines start to hit DS9’s shields. 15th ship. Cardassians begin evacuate the station, confused and a bit frightened at the spectacle. 

16.

The Female Changeling tells Weyoun to prepare for their departure, but Sisko tells her it won't be much longer. ""I don't care!"" She says, her voice cracking from fear, ""just let me get out of here!"" 

""I'm afraid I can’t do that,” Sisko says with a sly smirk. “You wanted your fleet here. I just want to oblige.” 

At this point, 30 fighters and capital ships are destroyed. The wormhole sends lines of Dominion ships into the cloud of doom, sending 1 ship every four seconds. After 100 ships have been destroyed does the Female Changeling run for the ship, but is tripped by an invisible force. 

""Oh, can I help you?"" A concerned voice asks. You look up. It is the Emissary, the Sisko himself, eyes blazing with the righteous power of the Prophets. The Female Changeling pleads, ""Just let me go. I'll do anything, please!"" 

He smiles and replies ""Oh you, chose your fate already. You could have ceased hostilities long ago, but you chose to press your might. Now, here is ours."" 

Changelings never cry, but the Female Changeling sets a new, chilling precedent. She crawls to the turbolift. It is locked. 

250 ships. 

The Female Changeling begins to lose cohesion. The Changeling, considered a god herself, begins to pray, hoping for a miracle.

 428 ships.

Dominion ships are now shooting out of the wormhole much like the Defiant’s pulse phasers. The Bajorans on the station gather onto Ops, citing the prayers of the Prophets, as the station is rocked by more and more debris and self-replicating mines. Soon the Changeling finds herself surrounded by her worst enemies of the Alpha Quadrant: The Sisko, Major Kira, Chief O’Brien, Jadzia Dax, Commander Worf, Admiral Ross, General Martok, Chancellor Gowron, Rom. Consoles explode, sparks shoot everywhere, the Female Changeling begins to recoil from increasing smoke.

2564 ships. 

As the Female Changeling counts to herself, at this rate the Dominion fleet should be completely destroyed by now. Power comes in and out on ops, and yet a lightning storm in space forms outside. The stars are now blocked by the storm and the increasing amount of mines. “Computer!” The Female Changeling shouts from the ground. “How many mines are in operation?” The computer buzzes quickly as it completes its scans and calculations. Ops continues to rock steadily from tiny impacts.  
   
 The computer replies, “65,000 mines remain.” The Female Changeling maintains her defiance. “Starfleet technology. Ever impressive and resourceful,” she says stoically. Making her final stand, she threatens, “With no more of my ships to fuel your replicated mines, my forces in the Alpha quadrant will…” She is then interrupted by the computer.  

“243,789 mines remain. 562,597 mines remain. 4,225,316 mines remain. 8 million 6 hundred…”

Space itself begins to tremble. The overhead lights in Ops shut down, with only the console panels and viewscreen providing light. 

32 million mines and counting. 

Nothing can stop the cataclysm. 

64 million mines. 

188 million mines. 

“HOW? HOW ARE THEY STILL REPLICATING?” she asks. There is no more material for the replicators to draw from. The law of conservation has been repealed by a higher judge. She turns to face Dukat, his hair spilling over his eyes as he laughs maniacally on his knees at their fates. He yells at her, “YOU! YOU DID THIS! YOUR HUBRIS!” He laughs equally in madness and acceptance.  Finally, the full force of the wave of self-replicating mines washes over Deep Space Nine. 

The fabric of the spacetime continuum begins to split. The wormhole turns into a red volcano of cosmic hellfire. The Bajorans sing praise to the Sisko. The Prophets fly majestically out of the wormhole with the decapitated heads of the Pah Wraiths mounted on their ancient spears of eternity. The Sisko himself sets fire to the system. The self-replicating mines continue to fill up the sector. Skies of Class M planets darken, their sunlight disappearing. The Female Changeling is already dead, the Alpha Quadrant paying the price for her greed. The mines begin to spill into the wormhole, dooming the Gamma Quadrant to a similar fate. The mass of the galaxy becomes unsustainable as a far off Federation starship in the Delta Quadrant is enveloped, doomed by technology that is their last contact with home. The Milky Way collapses into itself, causing a supermassive black hole the likes of which the universe has never seen before.

dealing individual mind,"This is of course an allusion to the Borg. It was Troi who said it. 

But I’m going to use it to make a point about Star Trek as a whole. I’ll apologize in advance because most trekkies won’t like it. It’s a mystical point. Even though Roddenberry was mystical, it seems most trekkies aren’t. That’s not a dig, just an observation.

Star Trek isn’t about politics, social issues, technology. It’s about mysticism. The vast majority of episodes are variations of that. Looking at mysticism from different angles. 

Which means, the meaning is below the surface. So it comes from below the surface. Below the surface of the ego-self. 

It comes from the collective unconscious. We aren’t dealing with individual minds. We are dealing with archetypes of the collective unconscious. To put it in Jungian terms.

Gene had a bit of experience in that area. He used Star Trek to try to convey that. But it’s a catch-22. If Star Trek had been unsuccessful, his mystical message wouldn’t reach anyone. If it’s too successful, the mysticism would be drown out by the entertainment value.

aliens spaceships,"I have no doubt this idea has been expressed before but please bear with me.

Given the nuance-less portrayal of most of the aliens in Star Trek, it would seem that some of the aliens shouldn't even be space-faring given that most alien races tend to be personifications of only one or two basic principles, while humans seem to be the ideological common ground (or is it because Star Trek is a human show so the humans would be the most  multidimensional race in the show?)

Take the Klingons. Their culture seems to be structured almost entirely on physical prowess, honour, and dominance in battle. Where anyone who doesn't seem to align with those ideals is labeled a coward and is not taken seriously until they forsake their cowardice and embrace the spirit of the warrior. With this behaviour, it seems unlikely that any sort of technological advancement that would not be applicable to warfare would be extremely slow or nonexistent.

Or the Vulcans. So they were brutally savage and then this one guy said ""logically speaking, this whole savagery thing is absurd."" and then everyone else said ""I concur, quite illogical."" and now they annoy us all with their logic. It seems to be nothing less than miraculous that their whole civilization did a 180 from brutal savagery to extreme sophistication and almost no one has looked back since. It would seem to be far more realistic for Vulcans to be more divided on the debate of the carnal pleasure of savagery vs the benefits of sophistication. Otherwise it would imply that their biology is more compatible with one lifestyle than the other which begs the question why they engaged in the other lifestyle at all.",startrek,1575335752,Rickjzz,14,1,True,2019-12-02

17. Visionary

""I always investigate Quark.""  Multiple O'Brien desths. A future Miles replaces current Miles, for the rest of the series. ""I hate temporal mechanics!"" is my favorite line.  Romulans speculating about Odo's feelings for Kira.


18. Distant Voices

Interesting episode concept.  Made Bashir interesting for me.


19. Through the Looking Glass

Excited to see more of the Mirror Universe.  Also, nice Tuvok cameo.


20. Improbably Cause

More Garak backstory.


21. The Die Is Cast

Cardassians and Romulans team up vs The Dominion, only *IT'S A TRAP*.  Garak really did a number on Odo.


22. Explorers

Sisko makes an ancient ship and ends up proving the Cardassians wrong!  Good to see a father-son story.


23. Family Business

Seeing Quark, Rom, and Moogie interact is hilarious.  Ferengi culture is backwards as it gets, but that's the point I guess. Ferengi IRS is also hilarious.

Also, Kasidy Yates is going to have to earn my trust - Penny Johnson played Sherri Palmer too well on 24 - I love how she's introduced though.  Sisko lighting up about baseball is delightful.  Also, Moogi!  and interesting camera work while Rom was with his mom.


24. Shakaar

O'Brien going in on the dart board in the opening.  Bajor didn't need a civil war and it was good to see both sides hold off in the canyon.  Except for that nervous solider and his itchy trigger finger.  Good to see Kai Wynn losing Fist Minister.


25. Facets

Thoroughly enjoyed this one. Meeting Curzon was delightful. I imagined we'd get a flashback to meet him, but using Odo was great!  Also Quark, why do that to your nephew?!?


26. The Adversary

Classic body-snatcher episode!  Why did Sisko and Kira have basic auto destruct confirmation codes (Sisko Alpha-one-Alpha, Kira beta-two-beta)?  Was Odo the first to hurt another changeling or was it the other one who hurt Odo first with the link? ""It's too late.  We're everywhere.""  Great cliffhanger!


Performance observations: The back and forth between Odo and Quark is consistently entertaining. Facets seemed like the most fun the cast had throughout the entire season. Season 3 has really picked up into binge speed. I thought for sure it was going to take a while to get through this season, but it has breezed by.

While I was never the biggest fan of the Queen, I didn't think she was bad in Voyager. I think she was acceptable as the leader of the Borg, personification of the hivemind or whatever you wanna call her. She's mostly pretty emotionless, calculating and cold. 

Then I watched First Contact expecting that same character. Boy was I wrong. She was seductive, oddly sexual, had a temper and felt more human than Borg. She just feels weirdly contradicting to the Borg as a species.",startrek,1575405325,Tom_Dynamite,14,1,True,2019-12-03

point think star trek stop culturally relevant,"Science fiction is peculiar because it phrases the present in terms of the future. If you look to a mythological tale or historical fiction, as they get older their presence only seems to grow stronger. Works like the Aeneid, the stories of King Arthur and even Buffalo Bill’s Wild West Shows seem to have more allure as their respective periods grow further away.

But what about stuff like this? Star Trek is a huge cultural phenomenon. While something like Star Wars was ruined by an over-controlling writer and bought out by Disney, I get the impression that Star Trek, well, boldly goes where no man has gone before. I can’t really say because I don’t watch it but from snippets I see of Jean-Luc Picard I get a sense of a very daring, heady and incredible show.

Now this might tie too much into the original series, but I wanted to ask. In retrospect Star Trek feels very, very one-dimensional. America good, Tyranny bad, Science good, oppression bad, equality good et cetera. I used to watch it alongside Lost in Space with my dad and they didn’t feel too different.

tng cause effect escape time loop inevitable,"I just watched this episode tonight, for the probably 9 millionth time. This is possibly my favorite TNG episode. If not my favorite, certainly one of the top episodes. It is such a classic TNG style ""mystery of the week"", that is all future-science based, not ""oh it was a magic alien all along!"". I also think they did a particularly clever job of lining up each replay of the time loop with an act of the show. So every time the ship blows up, it goes to commercial, then the show comes back, you see the ship flying through space, and at first you don't even notice it's not picking up where it left off. We've all seen so many TNG reruns at this point, we're just used to seeing the ship flying around. And we're programmed to have our TV shows make chronologic sense, so when they're totally out of whack, it doesn't register right away. I really like that about this episode, and it's an effect you totally lose watching it on DVD or BluRay. 

But on to topic at hand. I think it's safe to say that this episode at it's plot-based core, it about the crew figuring out that they can send a message to themselves in the next time loop, and data first doing that, and then him receiving the message in the next loop. The episode before that point is essentially all setup for this happening. And that message they send across time loops does become the key they use to free themselves, and Frasier, from the time loop.

But while watching it today, it occurred to me that their exit was inevitable. Even if they had never though to send a message to the next loop. Or even if they did and it failed. Or even if it turned out to be scientifically impossible to do so, they still would have exited the time loop in short order...

The key is the deja'vu. It kept getting worse and worse, and affecting more and more people. The crew was starting to be able to predict the future, it was getting so intense. Well, there is the real key to freedom! Lets forget the android phone call, so the time loop keeps looping. People's deja'vu will keep getting more and more intense and detailed. It should get to the point where they know everything that's going to happen right up to the explosion. They will know that they keep doing the tractor beam and it doesn't work. Given that scenario, they will keep trying different things each loop and eventually find a successful way to avoid the collision and exit the loop. 

Each time loop appeared to be about 24 to 48 hours long. They were in the loop for 17 days. That means there were between about 9 and 17 loops. And in the 5 or 6 we see. they quickly went from not really remembering anything, to seemingly remembering almost every moment, just not with perfect clarity or detail. It seems like they were only a few loops away from having enough memory, to know exactly what was coming. Forget about avoiding the collision without Data getting the message from himself... and back up a bit. It probably wouldn't have taken more loops for Picard to 'see' that his order to maintain course was wrong. And when Worf says ""we should reverse course"", he'll give a dramatic pause and then say 'yes, reverse course'. And that one action would instantly break them out of the loop. I'm not sure what effect that would have on the other ship, if the Enterprise exits the loop by avoiding the collision scene entirely. I guess the Bozeman would exit the loop by suddenly popping out into empty space all alone, and have a really awkward exchange with some other ship or space station or starfleet command. But as far as the Enterprise goes, I submit that they were not stuck in the loop per-say, and that they were at most a few days away from exiting the loop before they send Data a message, giving themselves a shortcut. 

Thus concludes my ""Cause and Effect"" book report :) But one more thing that always bugged me about this episode: why do they wait until they exited the loop before they check their ship time with a ""starfleet time beacon"". Also, isn't this something that should happen periodically anyway? And also while I'm ruining the premise of this episode, did command no one else in the whole galaxy try to talk to the enterprise during the 17 day period? Actually I guess that's yet another way they were destined to exit the loop. If all else failed, eventually Star Fleet command would have send them a message saying ""Where the F are you guys??"" The Enterprise would stop and instantly miss the collision and be out of the loop while they try to figure out why their clocks are 17 days off.",startrek,1575510887,l008com,7,1,True,2019-12-04

ds anyone else find way everyone treated religions unrealistic,"Please don't spoil the ending, I'm 7 episodes away.

Overall I love DS9, it got into depths I was not expecting out of Star Trek. It impressed me. I still prefer TNG's more cheery tone, but DS9 is still a great show.

However, everyone there seems to believe in whichever the other person's religion is. I mean, someone like Bashir, when Jadzia dies as a part of a Klingon house - they say ""Oh, she's in sto-vo-kor"". Respect and tolerance I understand, but this is something else. This is genuine belief in everyone's religion. They really believe in the great treasury for Ferengis. Not as an empathetic thing, they actually believe in Ferengi beliefs - regarding Ferengis, Klingon beliefs regarding Klingons, and so on.

This just doesn't make sense. When have you last seen a Christian genuinely say ""ah yes, Amir was a great friend. It's such a shame he died of cancer. Oh well, let's take solace in the fact that he's probably going to Jannah to bask in the glory of Allah. Now, I need to go pray to God and Jesus, our Messiah, obviously not just a past, outdated prophet, as Islam claims he is, take care""?

When have you heard an atheist say this:

""what a horrible car crash! My aunt, Rivka... She was a loyal follower of God. Not once has her belief wavered. I truly believe that by sticking to the path she belongs to as one of the chosen people, she will have a wonderful afterlife. I genuinely believe that. Let's say Kaddish on her soul, I actually, honestly believe that soul is real, and that saying Kaddish will help her soul immensely, like giving a living person a million dollars. She'll be resurrected like all of the other Jews that were buried in the proper Jewish way. This is what I genuinely believe. Feel free to verify that I actually think this is true.

As for Jane, she was such a great friend. It's such a loss. I know that she doesn't really have a soul, and that she stopped existing when she died, when her brain stopped producing electronic signals. Her body is not really very meaningful, it's just rotting organic matter. Honestly the most real thing that's left of her are memories, neuron firing patterns that are still maintained within living brains. There is no such thing as a god or a Messiah, she just stopped existing.


I hope Jake, that was killed alongside them, gets reincarnated into a good body. He was a great Hindu. Of course resurrection is real. His soul traveled from his body to the next. Yeah I know this explicitly contradicts Judaism, but he was a Hindu, not a Jew, so he gets reincarnated, and he really does have a soul, unlike Jane which only appeared to! ""

Never, right? Plenty of people respect others' beliefs, and that's great, but I don't think anyone genuinely believes that their beliefs are true, but only apply to them.

No one will honestly answer the question ""does Allah exist"" differently based on whether the subject of the conversation is a Muslim or an atheist.

It just bothers me. How does one honestly believe that all religions and the lack thereof are true, but that reality truly differs for each person based on their personal beliefs/lack thereof? If someone believes Allah exists, and is universal, how can you then not believe that Allah exists when talking about a Hindu, and then not believe that cows (or anything else for that matter) are holy when talking about an atheist?

There's a reality out there, even if we don't and never will know what it's true nature is, for sure, it does have some nature. A nature. Even if it's hyper-localised gods that only affect their believers. Even that wouldn't suffice because many religious beliefs involve universality. Localised religions used to exist according to the Bible (which I tend to believe in that regard because it fits with the reality people lived in at the time), but not really today. If even one person believes in universal gods rather than localised ones, then the belief system demonstrated among Starfleet in DS9 does not and cannot possibly work.",startrek,1575561475,lirannl,43,1,True,2019-12-05
battle tactics saucer shaped ships,"Warning: Minor Discovery season 2 spoilers, medium Wrath of Khan spoilers ( but seriously, it's a good movie, you should get on seeing that)

So I was watching the season 2 finally of Discovery, and couldn't help but scream at the screen when I noticed Control and our intrepid heroes were all aligned on the same plane.  It's especially annoying given what a big deal was made in Wrath of Khan about how Khan didn't consider fighting in 3d, having his entire 1990's battle experience be more or less planar.   


But then I got to thinking, maybe this is a viable tactic. The ships are extremely broad on one side, and extremely narrow on the other profile, so maybe our hero's are just keeping their profile down relative to the attackers. Then I realized that made the problem worse because Control should be taking advantage of their numbers... but I'm getting off topic. I do understand that the writers just didn't think through 3d, zero-g dogfighting because... well it's hard to think that way unless you are a dork like me or an actual star ship captain.   


I suppose my question is this: Have any of the series ever shown broadside, narrow side tactical flight stuff, and was it any good? My feeling is it would make the actual space battle stuff a lot more interesting, but I may be wrong.",startrek,1575571107,MelCre,47,1,True,2019-12-05

extraterrestrial life attempting communicate humanity,"A theme that's encountered many times in Trek canon is very strange alien lifeforms attempting to communicate with humanity and the Federation. VOY ""Twisted,"" DIS ""An Obol for Charon,"" and the original Star Trek feature film are all obvious examples, but there are others scattered throughout the franchise.

At this point, I'm fairly convinced that many kinds of life exist in the real universe, and that humanity is on the verge of making direct contact with some of them. After all, we're just now taking our first big steps into space. If they're out there, it's only a matter of time until it happens.

So it got me thinking: What if Star Trek itself is an alien civilization's attempt to bring humanity up to speed, to teach us the lessons we need to learn to survive an evolutionary bottleneck? Keeping in mind episodes like ENT ""Carbon Creek,"" this idea seems to fit right in with Trek canon. Aliens could be in some form of telepathic communication with Trek's creators, directing them where to take the series, and hence providing humanity with a guide to the stars.

At the very least, I think such a concept would make for a very good and thought-provoking episode of Star Trek.",startrek,1575623692,JonLuckPickard,27,1,True,2019-12-06

- Sulu we know about, hes been commanding excelsior for I think 3 years.

- McCoy states he has been CMO of enterprise for I think 27 years implying that's his current position. 

But, what was the ship doing. Was it laid up and reactivated and recrewed just for this mission? It appeared not to have a helmsman and it's kind of implied valeris is taking over from sulu even though it's been 3 years. If it wasnt and it was on active service, with spock away who was first officer. Kirk didnt know spock was talking to the klingons so he cant have been serving alongside him. McCoy's continuous service as cmo implies the enterprise was active. We also have the line from spock saying this will be his last voyage as a member of the crew and he hopes valeris will succeed him, which frankly is a bit much considering shes a lieutenant helmsman and hes a first officer ranked as a captain. 

We have a ship with a captain as captain, a captain as first officer, a captain as chief engineer and I believe a full commander (who already did a stint a decade prior as first officer of the reliant) as navigator, which makes it an unusual ship as we know.

I also find it interesting that their entire movement is human, the native males seem quite content from what we see of them.


Basically a group of aliens landed on this planet, didn't like their society and tried to force them to change, and instead of leaving when given the opportunity to leave acted like it was their god given right to stay on someone else's planet and try to make it more like the Federation, and Riker and the Enterprise backed them up! This is something that happens a lot on Star Trek, the crew find an alien world with different values and instead of accepting that people have different values and what's right for you might not be right for them and vice versa, they try to change it.

star trek always evolving discovery different," (TLDR at bottom)

Since the first episode of Star Trek: Discovery was released, I heard a multitude of people say that it wasn’t “true” Star Trek. Many said it was simply a science fiction show with a Star Trek label slapped on it. And in a way, I reluctantly agreed during the first few episodes. This was way different than anything we had seen before. The focus on a single character, more advanced technology and continuous storyline were unusual. But as the series progressed, I realized something -- Discovery was simply the next step in the evolution of the Star Trek franchise, and that evolution is key to keeping the franchise alive.

Let’s go way back in time and look at TOS (and TAS as well if you want to get specific). Every episode was a single storyline that rarely connected to another episode later down the line. Cool. This is where we started out and people liked it. But this isn’t where we stayed.

By the time TNG came to be, Star Trek had already evolved significantly, not only in technology, but in the style of show. Suddenly there were events that connected to other episodes further on, such as the death of Tasha Yar, the being and further trauma of Locutus of Borg, and the iconic trial of humanity that Q snaps into existence in the first and last episodes of the series. This isn’t at all like TOS. There is change and progression of concepts throughout the series, and people liked it too.

DS9, again, was very different than the series that prefaced it. The first few seasons started out similar to TNG, but as soon as the Dominion storyline and eventual war was introduced, Star Trek went through a major change. Now, here was this whole concept that connected not only episode to episode, but season to season. This story brought the franchise to a whole new level that would have been totally unimaginable in TOS days. Nonetheless, the franchise persists with strength.

VGR is a bit of a curveball in this evolution, but with good reason. Each episode here is very much its own with small connections overtime, besides the obvious overarching concept of returning to the Alpha quadrant. I think the reason this series did not evolve in the way the others did is because DS9 and VGR overlapped so much during their air time. Having two ongoing storylines happening at the same time would be a lot to keep track of, especially considering that they were entirely disconnected from each other being in different quadrants and all. Still, VGR takes on a very TNG like style.

ENT, from my viewpoint, looked to be headed in a similar direction to DS9 before it was cancelled. The temporal cold war was brewing and with Archer stuck in the middle, things were getting interesting. Still, even though we can’t exactly know where it was going, the evolution was demonstrated by pulling a broader storyline into the mix the very first episode, instead of waiting like DS9. We also see a bit of a larger focus on one character as opposed to all characters getting (mostly) equal screen time. Archer is without a doubt focused on a great deal more than Malcolm or Travis, (however, the issue with that in this series was the lack of actually interesting qualities about these side characters, but that’s a discussion for another day).

Then comes DSC. Admittedly, this evolution occurs a bit more drastically than the others, but it aligns nonetheless. Now we have a storyline that begins the very first episode like ENT *and* is followed in every episode like the second half of DS9. We have a main character, much more than we did in ENT. This is a big change, but it falls right in line with the progression of the franchise so far. 

These changes are 100% necessary and calculated. All of them were. Despite what many die-hard, long-term fans want to believe, a Star Trek series eventually needs new fans to engage with the content just as much as returning fans. People die off, become disinterested between series or simply forget to watch. For a show to sustain itself, it has to appeal to new audiences. In Star Trek’s case, these are probably younger generations. But if you give younger generations a TOS style show with a different story every week and no main character and technology that isn’t far off of what exists right now, and you won’t gain a following. Because that isn’t what entertainment as a whole has evolved into.

There is still so much to DSC that makes it truly Star Trek. The series combines concepts from past series with new ideas that can reach both audiences. One can enjoy the show without knowing previous canon just as much as someone who knows every episode by heart. The ideas of diversity, exploration and morality are still explored in new and exciting ways that align with the core values of the franchise. The characters have depth and the story has real-world applications. This is what Star Trek has always been, despite its many changes throughout the years. 

These are the things that make a series “truly” Star Trek. This is why the franchise must persist and follow some modern entertainment trends, not from a business standpoint, but from a cultural one. The way Star Trek has addressed relevant issues and human qualities has always been unique, and in its uniqueness has a way of reaching people loud and clear. The need for that quality in entertainment will never, and should never, die out. To reach another generation, and another after that, is keeping alive a stream of hope within an ever growing community of people who see the world through these values. And because of the continued success in that goal, while people’s tastes in entertainment are their own to choose, I cannot see a way in which Discovery is not distinctly and profoundly Star Trek in every way.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Discovery is part of a natural evolution of the Star Trek franchise in terms of style. A continuous storyline and main character is the result of evolution throughout the many series. The values in Star Trek are what's important to keep alive and are what makes a series truly Star Trek.",startrek,1575656867,SassySpock1701,211,1,True,2019-12-06

Let me also say I’ve been quite lenient with the “excellent mark”, if I thoroughly enjoyed the episode and I thought it highlighted some social aspect or moral dilemma I threw it in there.

story star trek episode,"This is my pitch. This episode, called ""Ancestors"", would be somewhere in Season 4 or Season 5 of Voyager.

In this episode, USS Voyager's crew finds out that they are actually all holograms, existing in an ancestor simulation being run in the far future by the crew of GSS Voyager, the flagship of Galactic Union's extragalactic exploration fleet. By their time, the Federation has long ago joined together with several galactic powers, forming the Union as a transgalactic alliance, which has since grown to include nearly the entire known Milky Way galaxy. It is currently in the process of exploring galaxies of the Local Group.

GSS Voyager's crew is looking for a way to deal with highly unusual subspace anomaly and have been searching through their historial holoarchives for days without finding any answers. Captain of GSS Voyager and a descendant of Janeway's has chosen to reveal their predicament to our holographic crew because the anomaly has corrupted the simulation of USS Voyager. By locking it into a loop and removing perception filters, software restrictions, and other safeguards, it allowed the crew to grow beyond mere simulations into complete sentient beings in a matter of hours.

By this point in time, sentient holographic beings are considered fully equal to organic beings, and Galactic Union's law entitles our holographic crew to all rights to life and self-determination enjoyed by 24th century Federation organics. Accordingly, they are offered a choice to join future Voyager's crew if they want to, as GSS Voyager's crew feels it's their obligation to assist them. Naturally, nearly everyone on our crew is greately distressed by this realisation, except most prominently The Doctor, who finds the whole situation very amusing and flings snarky remarks at his fellow holographic shipmates during the entire episode.

Many members of the crew wonder what sort of life awaits them if they join GSS Voyager's crew. Some think they would be living relics of a time long gone and merely faint echos of people who have been dead for centuries. And some even want to be deleted. Eventually though, they manage to come to terms with their situation and they aid the crew of GSS Voyager, allowing them to deal with the anomaly and continue their mission of extragalactic exploration. The episode ends with holographic Janeway asking her descendant to tell her if real USS Voyager ever managed to return home. She answers yes and offers to show her how the story ends.",startrek,1575678772,maximus-butterworth,9,1,True,2019-12-06

In The Replacements, Xander is hit by a weapon which creates a second Xander, which as it turns out actually split him into the strong and weak versions of himself. It's later determined that both of them are parts of the true Xander and that you couldn't kill one without killing the other, so the team has to figure out how to reunite the two beings. There's also a romantic parallel between Evil Kirk and Yeoman Rand and Strong Xander and Anya.

connor trinneer wonderful actor want thank inspiring younger trip enterprise,"As a young engineer(and also a southern boy), I'd have to say he had a lot in my decision of my career.  I loved watching Enterprise through middle school, it was the newest Trek on at the time and it helped me sort of ""escape"" for awhile.  

His accent drew me in and my first thought was ""wow he sounds like me.""  As the episodes went on I felt like he represented the idea of a more tolerant and improved Southern United States.  By the time I finished Cogenitor...I have no idea how to explain.  His acting in this episode is phenomenal.  His emotions, his desire to show someone their right to choose, and his sadness at the end.  

He brought performances like that throughout the series as well as having Trip be an extremely capable engineer, and a good friend.  My interest in the character because of Connors acting made me decide to look go school for engineering and start my career.  I still have a lot of school left to finish one day but I love my current job where I get to apply what I know everyday.

rant rick berman,"I'm a pretty new Star Trek fan. I found myself interested when I started watching Discovery with my (now) husband. He then got me watching TOS, which was pretty awesome, but by the time we got 2 episodes deep into TNG I was completely freaking hooked. I think back on the days when I thought Star Trek was lame (without ever having watched it) and I cringe at myself. We just finished TNG and the 2 subsequent movies, and I now consider myself a die-hard fan. Yay!

That said, I'm also kind of new to this community, and I don't know how you all feel about Rick Berman; therfore I don't really know how lightly I need to tread or whatever. All I can say is that I just NEED to express my disgust somewhere, and I don't tweet. So thanks for reading!

After TNG, we watched a little bit of the ""behind the scenes"" episode that was included with the series on Netflix. I think it's important to mention that going into it, I had absolutely no idea who Rick Berman was except that he was a producer. I had no knowledge of his reputation, whether it was good or otherwise. But when he started talking about the characters, he mentioned the most absurd things about Crusher and Troi. All he had to say about Crusher - who happened to have the highest medical position on the ship, saved countless lives in numerous episodes, highly esteemed in Starfleet and advanced her career to include being a commanding officer on the bridge - all he had to say about her whole character arc was that we got to watch her face motherhood from a unique perspective. I mean... Ok? He could have talked about all the super impressive things about her character, and yet he chooses to mention her ""motherhood."" 

Then he started talking about Troi. Not about how we watched her go from a bit of a timid person to the strong character she becomes; not about how the entire ship's crew trusts her to help them navigate their own personal shit as well as her own struggle to climb the ladder to become a commanding officer on the bridge; no. He wants to talk about how her hair was ""weird"" in the first few seasons but they finally got it to a place where it looks good now. And that's pretty much it. Nothing substantial about her character arc, either!

So I turned to my husband and pointed this out, and he says ""that's why he's known as 'Rick the Dick."" Infuriated, I can't watch any more of that episode and my husband seemed put off by it, too. 

THEN, I went and found a YouTube video where he discusses Janeway's character in Voyager. It was more of the same; a lot of hair talk, but he starts it by talking about how they really wanted a ""feminine"" woman to be captain. That ""women who make the rank of captain or admiral in the military are usually not babes,"" or some creepy sexist shit like that, while making a face indicating his disgust at the thought of a female captain or admiral. I haven't watched but one episode of Voyager yet, but I can only imagine that Janeway is more than a ""babe"" with great hair. 

I guess I expected more from a producer of a show that puts so much emphasis on equality and fair diplomacy. After doing so much great work, how could he have missed the message?",startrek,1575684963,Gilliac,185,1,True,2019-12-06

timeline trek prime split,"Just for the fun of it, when do you think our real timeline and the Trek Prime timeline split off?

Using the Eugenics War as the main discrepancy and Montalban's real age of 46 in 66/67, the split had to happen before the 1950s at the absolute latest.

Since eugenics is a multi-generational process that would suggest the programs had been in place in secret since the theories originations in the 1880's, meaning the split had to happen then or earlier, as that would give, say, 5 generations of forced breeding to create Khan &amp; Co.

Unless Eugenics is retconned into genetic manipulation without controlled breeding.

If its retconned then McCoy venturing back to the 1930's the obvious guess - somehow McCoy's time travel led to an increase in genetic research, causing the creation of Khan and his super men/women.

Personally, I put the split at 86 - 66 million years ago.  In the Trek universe some Aliens picked up a whole lotta Hadrosaurs for there zoo.  In our universe, the aliens didn't bother.",startrek,1575697091,Mildly_Irritated_Max,6,1,True,2019-12-07

The Romulan D'Deridex and Valdore warbirds have huge wingspans because they have huge wings.  In fact, the Valdore is almost entirely wings, with a very thin central section.

Are the wings inhabitable?  Meaning, is that usable space inside the ship or are the wings basically just for show?  I've always assumed that the wings on Romulan ships weren't really intended for use, except maybe as access points to the nacelles, but I'm having second thoughts.  The Valdore would be wasting a ton of space if there were no decks inside those wings. Also, if you ever had to do nacelle repairs or maintenance, you'd basically have to travel the length of a Sovereign class ship to get out there.

xcom would make perfect star trek game,"As a gamer I have a hard time accepting the fact there isn't a single game that's good at being Star Trek. There are good games with Star Trek brand on them, but they don't capture what the series is about. Because it's not JUST about space battles, or running the ship, or planetary missions. 

(The closest thing to perfection would be ST Online, but it's undercooked and basic in many areas while being overly complex.)

However, recently I played XCOM, a turn-based strategy, which would be just PERFECT, all it needs is reskinning.

So in XCOM you're a commander of a base which you develop and you send your away teams to fight aliens.

That's the perfect setup: you have the base, which would be the ship, and away missions, which feature a team of 4-6 crewmen. In XCOM, you have your ops with map view (bridge!), your ready room (ready room), a workshop (engineering), laboratory (medical), generator rooms (warp drive), this is all on multiple levels that you access via an elevator (turbolift). 

You need to observe alien activity in Earth's many regions (just make it the areas of the Federation), you share technology with countries (share your findings with Romulans for cloak technology, maybe?), you save civilians on away missions by walking to them (""one person to beam out!""). You have an officer who advises you (just make him Riker or Data or Spock), you have a female scientist (Crusher), a lead engineer (Geordi), and a mysterious higher-up who you only see on a viewscreen (any shady Federation general).

Your enemies are various species within an alien consortium, which is simply the Dominion!

When upgrading the armor of your away team members, you change their costumes, which would be a perfect excuse to go from TOS uniforms to TMP to TWoK, or from TNG to TNG's later seasons to DS9 to TNG movies.

Everything adds up so perfectly, and the game is based on planning and thinking - unlike so many ST games, which are action-based. This would be a Star Trek game I'd fall in love with.

Does it bother anyone else that all of the windows (port holes) on the Enterprise D are the exact same angle in every stateroom we see, even though the angle of the hull obviously isn’t the same all over the ship. In fact it varies quite a bit. And in most cases the angle, as seen from inside the ship would be much steeper than what is depicted. 
Same with the shuttle bay hatches. From the interior of the ship they are perfectly vertical but none of the shuttle bay hatches on the exterior match that. Not to mention the various cargo bays that we see.

* The ship had this unique design because it had a lot of shuttles and shuttlebays.
* The ship class started with a C, K or a similar sounding letter.

almost entire enterprise tng carpeted,"So I'm on my first watchthrough of TNG and midway through an episode I just started wonder why is this whole ship carpeted? Even sick bay has a carpeted floor, which seems incredibly unhealthy and unsanitary. Sure their medical practices are much more advanced, but at some point someones gotta be in there with combat wounds and dripping blood, or infectious bacterias and such being caught in the carpet. Also just for transporting things around the ship, pushing trolleys and moving supplies and parts etc., you'd want to push that stuff on a hard smooth surface. Plus the carpet would be pretty dirty with everyone tracking stuff on their shoes from offship missions and going down to planets, and something requiring a mop to clean would be much more efficient then a carpet.

So I gather it's mostly a set design thing that there'd be carpet, but was curious if there's a functional reason in show.

- The flashback montages at the end are cheesy as hell but kind of work... except Worf. All his memories seem to be from the last 6 weeks for some reason, and NONE OF THEM ARE OF JADZIA? The love of his life? 

- I would have killed Sisko completely, left him with the profits, that was his destiny. The ""I will return at some point in history"" thing was just odd and felt like a bit of a cop out.

- There's a lovely long pull out of the station at the end. They pan back really far and the station disappears but - no Bajor? Where is Bajor?

Also, as others have said, DS9 is pretty unique in 90s Trek as to how modern it seems now, due to the non-episodic nature of it. Plus I had a whole new appreciation for the Bajoran religion stuff and characters like Kai Wyn that I just dismissed when I was younger.

**Season 3:** The Xindi stressed me out but in a good way. The first (I believe) season long story ark worked. The ship almost getting murdered to death in *Azati Prime* may have been one of the highlights of the entire series for me. Great scene.

**Season 4:** Same as S2. Good but not great. I think this was more about personal preferences for me because it had a bunch of Trek elements that aren't my favorite (ex. time travel, Mirror Universe, whatever *Daedalus* was supposed to be).

**Final thoughts:**

* I have never seen a character with less development than Travis Mayweather. I mean not just in Trek but in any show or movie I've ever seen. I think he got one centric episode in S1 and that's it.
* Why would you have a character get pregnant 5 episodes in? Why would you have a male character get pregnant 5 episodes in? Why would you have a character that we literally just met get pregnant 5 episodes in? Just why?
* *These Are The Voyages*, on its own, wasn't a terrible episode but it SHOULD NOT have ended the series (controversial I know). You can make what is essentially a TNG holodeck episode work without it centering around the NX-01's final mission. That could've been the second-to-last episode and have the finale be something a little more spectacular that still jeopardizes the Enterprise's chances at arriving home on time. Also, I don't dislike Riker at all but he did not need to kiss T'Pol on the cheek. That was a little unwarranted IMO.
* Porthos is the goodest boy.
* Lastly... I'm just gonna say: **Trip ain't dead.**

1. He acted very out of character when the dudes boarded the ship. Was this all apart of a bigger plan? (Sidebar: Why weren't Archer and Trip armed? Where in the blue hell was MACO? That whole damn scene confused me.)
2. That was the least subtle wink I've ever seen. We never actually see him die. He just goes into the imaging chamber like a roast going into the oven and that's it. No one even seems particularly upset about it. Are they all in on it? Is this a &gt;!Section 31!&lt; operation? I have more questions than answers.

serious question friendlier sub better forums discussing trek,"I am not trying to be a troll, but this sub is extremely hostile towards Discovery and anything J.J.  Every post (as seen by the front page), is met with downvotes, and people's general hostility if you have a positive, or even good opinion about the New Trek, or Discovery.

It's getting old now and it's not very welcoming. /r/star_trek was branched because of that purpose.  It seems it starting to bleed into this sub.

Everyone says ""don't worry about what people say, you can like it if you want.""  That's fine, but you can't have a **discussion** about anything new, or even have a competent conversation about it, because it's always met with ""STD, it's Not Star Trek"" etc etc.  Those are not discussions.  That's just pure hatred, and nothing good comes out of it.

Honestly, if I was a new Star Trek fan, I would be very put off by this.  

This was very well thought out:

This is a painting, of course about The Next Generation, 1850 upvotes.  This doesn't spark discussion.

I can guarantee if it was Discovery or NuTrek, it would be downvoted to hell, or the passive agressive comement about the new Star Trek.

take shot whenever someone says scientist scientific tng suspicions,"In the first ten minutes of the episode you will have literally taken 18 shots and will probably need to be rushed to the hospital. Sub Rosa, Shades of Grey are terrible in their own ways, but for just flat out terrible execution ""Suspicions"" is my pick. The awful dialogue is just one of the problems. Other issues:  


* Why is Doctor Crusher suddenly so interested in metaphasic shielding to fly ships into the sun? It makes no sense that the entire episode revolves around her, nor does it fit her character that she would consistently do reckless things to help some random ""scientist"". This feels like a Geordie episode that got (very quickly) re-written for some reason.
* Why can't they just put the test ship on auto-pilot? There's literally nothing being done that a human has to be there for.
* This is the only episode in the entire series where even Patrick Stewart's acting seems stiff and flat. He looks like he's mentally checked out as he delivers these terrible, melodramatic lines, although who can blame him. His ""comforting"" of Crusher after the pilot's death and Riker's warning to her not to do anything stupid later on are standout clunkers. 
* Ending the episode by introducing Bev Crusher's killer karate moves, something we've never seen before or since.

psa patrick stewart likes action bad decisions,"Reading the recent Picard trailer thread - it reminded me of a certain tendency amongst fans to portray anything action packed as being *done to the actors* by studio executives and writers who do not understand *true* Trek.

At best, it is a misunderstanding and at worse a misrepresentation.

I cannot speak for the other actors but it is well documented that the reason that we see so much action in the TNG films is not studio mandate but because Patrick Stewart *wanted it* - he simply was not interested in repeating what was on the TV (and with Picard he is not interested in TNG 2.0).

Stuff like the dune buggy scene in Nemesis is there because PS wanted it. In insurrection, he heavily vetoed various talky bits (according to the unreleased book of the film) because he thought they would be boring.

I am using PS as the example here but often some of the stuff that fans claim is from people who do not understand the character comes directly from the actors themselves!

Given PS is so vital to Picard, if we see anything that people claim is out of character, I doubt that he did have a strong veto over it.",startrek,1575840178,cgknight1,0,1,True,2019-12-08

As Gul Dukat said, ""A true victory is to make your enemy see they were wrong to oppose you in the first place.""

Odo did exactly that. He shared with his people the empathy he had gained by living among their enemies. He taught them to value life that was different from their own and to realize how wrong they were to hurt others simply because of their differences.

But Odo didn't begin that way. In the beginning he was bitter, cynical, and distrustful. It was through his struggles with Quark and Garak, his relationship with Kira (and Lwaxana), and the help of his other friends on DS9 that he became a kind and caring person.

riker kill yuta,"In TNG: ""The Vengeance Factor"", Picard was trying to aid the negotiation between the Acamarians and the Gatherers. However, the crew discovered that Yuta, a servant to the Acamarian leader was a member of the clan Tralesta, who was seeking vengeance of the Lornak clan (the clan that Gatherers' leader belonged to). So, Riker ended up killing Yuta to prevent Yuta killing the Gatherers' leader.

But...it seem an atypical action of Starfleet members to do something like this. It seems to contradict the Prime Directive in so many ways. 

(1) How come Riker couldn't have just fought Yuta and taken her custody? Why did he have to kill? Starfleet tried to avoid killing as much as possible. It seems quite unusual for a Starfleet member to kill when there could be alternative actions. They could have continued stunning her until she couldn't move and let Chorgan escape. 

(2) The Prime Directive states that they shouldn't interfere in another society's natural course of development. Killing Yuta is interfering. Yuta would have succeeded if Starfleet hadn't been there at all, and their society would have progressed in a different way. 

(3) How come Picard didn't say anything? And shouldn't Riker checked with him before taking such extreme actions?",startrek,1575889315,aspielogician,35,1,True,2019-12-09

And I can’t really pin down why.  Seth McFarlane made the point that Star Trek should be episodic and not serialized and maybe that it part of it, but I loved BSG and other serialized SF.  Everybody in my family feels the same way we just aren’t in to it.  Which sucks.

I don’t know.  But my whole family is so much looking forward to Picard but we aren’t even talking about it because what if we feel the same way and then edging Jean Luc Picard is wrecked a little for us?",startrek,1575909283,Okay_that_is_awesome,12,1,True,2019-12-09

The show would be call Star Trek Galaxy(yes, I stole that from RLM, it could also be called Star Trek Andromeda)

We open on a massive banquet hall meeting, with hundreds of people and several different races. Bajorans, Klingons, Vulcans, etc. Celebrating the 300th anniversary of the founding of the United Federation of Planets. We pan the camera over to a table next to a stage, there’s one chair empty. It’s labeled, “Admiral William T Riker.” The Camera pans upward as we see a figure, Riker, walking towards a podium. (This is mostly fan service) Riker gives a small retirement speech and welcomes the head of the Cardasian Union, and congratulates him for joining the Federation.(this is meant to set the stage that this is a new era of peace and prosperity in the galaxy)

We then pan down, the Cardasian speaking in the background to a table with a human(the captain), an Andorian(the first officer), a Vulcan(chief scientist) and a Ferengi(he will either be a comms officer or something else, not sure) and a Romulan defector(tactical officer)The captain gets a communication, he acknowledges this and walks out to the garden. The communication is about something the captain is interested in, but they need to be on a secure channel. The captain walks back, grabs the crew and heads down to a comms room. 

They get there and they open a secure channel. The admiral states that they have found an Iconian gateway. The Ferengi asks about the iconians and we get some exposition. The Admiral has them head back to their ship and head to the system the gateway is. The captain asks about a chief engineer, and the admiral says that he will assign one later, and asks if the Vulcan can double as both for right now. The Vulcan responds yes. 

We cut to traffic control, giving the clear for the ship to leave Earth space dock and go to warp. The doors open and we see the ship(which looks from below like [this.](https://www.flickriver.com/photos/97598461@N07/16527305449/) ) The ship moves over the camera, with the designation, “NCC-1701 H.” The camera moves into the bridge, the captain says engage, the Enterprise goes to warp and the title sequence begins.

After that, we enter the system, and see what the gateway is. It’s a massive oval shaped object, orbiting around a gas giant. The admiral appears on screen, saying that there is a smaller station closer to thetas giant that seems to be a power station. The captain leaves the first officer and then Ferengi and brings the Romulan and the Vulcan. 

On the station they split up. The Vulcan finds a cryogenic chamber with a humanoid figure in it. He opens it and a being falls out. They look human, except for a head marking and the fact that their chest seem to be made of energy, and won’t interact with matter. The captain finds logs from what seems to be an iconian in the last days of the empire. And the Romulan finds the main power hub. After some technobabble, he powers the station on and subsequently the gateway opens up. 

They beam back and on screen the gateway opens up and in it you see a cracked planet, the core exposed and continental plates drifting from the surface. The admiral contacts the Enterprise saying that a disturbance is coming from the portal that is preventing warp travel within 5 light years. The Enterprise and two other ships enter the gateway.

(This is taking longer than I expected)

Once they get to the other side, the Captain asks where they are. The Vulcan is taken back a bit and says that they are 2.5 million light years from their last position. In the andromeda galaxy. The captain, although taken back, asks the Vulcan where the disturbance is coming from.

The Vulcan notes that the signal is coming from a base on a nearby moon. He also notes that the moon is breaking apart since it’s in the Roche limit. The captain decides they need to get as much intel as possible and sends the Andorian, Ferengi and the new person, since they probably can help.

On the base they find the console to stop the disturbance, but they can’t read the language. However the new person can and disables it, and finds and translates an audio log from the Same iconian as before. The base starts breaking apart and they get out of there in a quick action scene. From orbit the base disintegrates as the ground gets pulled off by the planet. 

They get back to the bridge. The Vulcan notes urgently that the Gate way is being pulled apart by the gravity of the planet and if they don’t stop it in 20 minutes the gate way will be unusable. Through tractor beams and the help of the new person they stop the gateway from being destroyed. End episode.

The 1st to 5th season sees the Enterprise and other ships exploring the andromeda galaxy, uncovering more about the iconians and dealing with some problems back home. The new person becomes chief engineer and is shown to be highly intelligent, but is a clone and has to deal with the side effects of that. Throughout these seasons we see what the iconians were, until the fourth where we see they still exist, they just haven’t either seen us or decided to contact us. In the fifth season, the finale has the enterprise arrive at a factory world, but then they uncover that it really was an extermination world, as the iconians learned not to allow species to rise up against them again. This episode also sees the iconians send ships after the enterprise and this sparks the Milky Way -Andromeda Galactic war, being reminiscent of the dominion war.

dis season stakes damn high spoilers,"I'm up to episode 5 of season 2. The stakes are too damn high.

Every episode is like: We're running out of time!

The production is obviously high, the acting is mostly great, but the tension-building--especially in the mycelium episode (the ship is falling apart, per the bridge crew, and the rescue team is taking its sweet-ass time, talking about feelings, and  true love)--it's like it is being ratcheted up to 15. It's unnatural, annoying, and since I know nobody is going to die, none of it means anything. Every time I thought the rescue team got it \[the immediacy of leaving\], someone else would open their damned mouth to try and say something profound. Likewise, on the bridge, someone was always shouting ""I can buy you another three minutes!""

We'll never get another episode where Data tries to teach Spot anything, or tries to watch a kettle of water boil. Burnham isn't going to be playing the flute *a la* Picard. It's okay to have a slow episode, where the series can fucking breath. Not everything has to be a race against the clock.

Still, it's better than *The Mandalorian*, which I quit after two episodes, but not as good as *The Orville.*

Also, Stamets jeopardized the safety of the crew because of his love for his partner. You're supposed to be an officer on a starship who can make the tough choices when they really matter.

The Cardassians are part of the federation and The Bajorians are the baddies. Now this brings me to my thought... instead of Wesley being on The Enterprise as a lieutenant and working the tactical station (which doesn’t fit Wesley at all), I think it should’ve been O’Brien. It just makes sense since with the situation with Bajor, Miles should’ve never been placed on DS9.

suppose remiss post ren anecdote,"If you live in L.A. long enough, you'll eventually have some funny celebrity stories to tell.  I'm almost ashamed to admit that, as an L.A. native, my best ones aren't my own.  There's the one where my mother completely embarrassed herself trying to talk to Sting (the musician, not the wrestler).  And there's the one where my sister ran afoul of this cantankerous old man.

Some time during the '00s, she and a couple of her friends were on their way to a house party somewhere in the Hollywood hills.  For those unfamiliar, those streets are narrow and windy and sometimes very steep.  They had poor cell reception and couldn't tell where they were, so they pulled over to try to get their bearings.

This ""old dude"" rushes out of his house and starts yelling at them about being on a private road.  A lot of tourists go up there trying to get a good view of the Hollywood sign, and the upper class residents hate it.  My sister tries to explain she's not a tourist, and she's trying to get to wherever the house party was, and her GPS isn't working, etc.  He doesn't believe her at all and tells them to get the hell out of there.  They try to turn around by backing into his driveway (there's no space on the road, being narrow), and he about loses his shit.  Apparently, the last tourist who got lost smashed his brick wall.

So they eventually make it out and the rest of the night was a success.  Not long after, she tells me a funny story about a Hollyweird actor from ""one of your Trek shows"".  She didn't know his name, but I put her description together and showed her a pic of Odo and yup, wouldn't you know it, he's retired from the Great Link and yelling at passersby to get off his lawn, so to speak.

This story is always my go-to when I find myself in a conversation about celebrity encounters.

star trek reviews,"This may prove to be a controversial post but here goes!

Whilst I'm undertaking a binge watch of any particular Star Trek show, I like to read a review after each episode just to see if my opinion is shared or wildly different. I also enjoy reading others insights.

Primarily I read Jammer's reviews and occasionally Kethinov. I've found that, bar one or two exceptions, Jammer's reviews tend to match my own opinions.

With that in mind and being very bored during a sick day, I wondered what the average episode review score was for each series and built a simple excel spreadsheet to work it out.

Each episode is rated between 0 and 4 stars in half increments. These are purely from Jammer's reviews, if I'm bored enough at some point I might work it out for other reviewers too. So from lowest to highest the average episode score for each show:

TNG: 2.61
TOS: 2.62
VOY: 2.63
ENT: 2.64
DIS: 2.76
DS9: 2.95

And per Season:

TNG Season 1: 2.20
TOS Season 3: 2.27
TNG Season 7: 2.44
TNG Season 2: 2.45
ENT Season 2: 2.48
VOY Season 2 - VOY Season 3: 2.58
VOY Season 4: 2.60
VOY Season 5: 2.62
VOY Season 7: 2.63
ENT Season 4: 2.64
VOY Season 6: 2.65
ENT Season 1: 2.68
TNG Season 5: 2.65
VOY Season 1- DIS Season 1: 2.73
TOS Season 2 - TNG Season 6 - ENT Season 3: 2.75
DIS Season 2 - 2.79
TNG Season 4 - 2.81
TOS Season 1: 2.84
DS9 Season 3: 2.87
DS9 Season 1: 2.89
TNG Season 3 - DS9 Season 6: 2.90
DS9 Season 5 - 2.98
DS9 Season 2 - 3.00
DS9 Season 4 - DS9 Season 7: 3.02

star trek picard showrunner michael chabon leave sometime oversee another series based novel showtime,"[Variety](https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/michael-chabon-kavalier-and-clay-series-showtime-overall-deal-with-cbs-tv-studios-1203431199/):

**Michael Chabon and Ayelet Waldman Set ‘Kavalier and Clay’ Series at Showtime, Overall Deal With CBS**


&gt; An adaptation of Michael Chabon’s acclaimed novel “The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay” has been given a series commitment at Showtime.


&gt; The series comes as part of a multi-year overall production pact which Chabon and his producing partner Ayelet Waldman have inked with CBS TV Studios. Under the agreement, CBS will have the exclusive rights to produce TV content created and developed by the husband-and-wife team across all platforms.

Here is the bit about ‘Star Trek: Picard’

&gt; **Chabon currently serves as an executive producer on the forthcoming CBS All Access series “Star Trek: Picard,” and he will remain with the series until he transitions to showrun “Kavalier and Clay” sometime in 2020, per CBS.**



Chabon responded to a question about this on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/B55xlo5gIdx/) saying the following:

enough mystery star trek,"Think of all the things we don't know today. We have deep mysteries in physics. The philosophers are still splitting finer and finer hairs in long-standing debates that appear to be insoluble. Economics is still closer to religion than science. We know very little about life in the deep ocean. There are swathes of history which are dark corridors of our past. 

Now think of Star Trek. A new civilization ever week. A new mystery, which is conveniently resolved by the end of the episode(!). The Federation is basically a quilt of West Liberal Democracies and species that are fundamentally human in motivation (although sometimes a caricature of a human motivation) and looks. Basically, we're all human, but some of us have unfortunate skin conditions. And the mysteries are shallow (e.g., ""Turns out it's Time Travel,"" ""Holodeck is on the Fritz Again,"" ""That Wacky Transporter,"" ""I'll take tachyons for $500, Alec,"" ""Alien politics is human politics,"" ""Alien psychology is human psychology,"" ""Turns out they were just misunderstood"").  

Why did fans like the Borg? Because they were a mystery. They were a seemingly unstoppable force. They didn't respond to conventional human psychology. Data could not out reason them. Picard could not overwhelm them with persuasion. Troi could not use her psychic powers to get into the opposition's ""play book."" When did the Borg start to suck? 

Star Trek would benefit from more mystery. Deep mysteries. Not mysteries of the episode or even mysteries of the season-long arc, but simply mysteries. Species that you don't really understand. Physics problems that cannot be penetrated by LaForge's visor and which cannot be solved by hacking the main deflector. Reality problems that don't resolve to worm-hole aliens or bored super-humans playing the universe game on ""God Mode.""  

Part of what makes our lives marvelous and terrifying are great unanswered questions. Indeed, death-awareness has been argued to have been the font of a great many things (our great achievements being a sort of death-denial). Hamlet's ""To be or Not to Be"" is great, because Hamlet does not really know the answer to the question. 

Star Trek tends to be too self-assured, too-self-contained, and too perfect, because it is all too often answering questions rather than exploring them.",startrek,1576012594,YARNIA,20,1,True,2019-12-10

prime directive analysis first contact theory blow mind,"Think about it, if warp travel exists on a species it has to be detected by another one who already has it.

But they cannot be certain who has it, what planet it came from, it could be another species that are already at warpfaring capabilities but hasn't been discovered.  However, the chance of an alien species that has not undergone first contact but has warp capability is the ideal chance to spread your empiire, again'st the unknown, as a buttress against fate.

But whats the risk, you went down to that planet, and rather than be the one who identified warp you are the one who gave them warp.  Because you didnt identify where on the planet it came from, you had to take a risk to maek sure it was that species.

Therefore, every first contact event is a risk by a captain and a crew, and it is an essential and highest duty of the prime directive, to take a chance to violate it, and make a first contact event happen.

This is why it is so rare.

This is why the human race would not trust it with anyone but themselves.

Which is why Captain Picard handled it himself, rather than let Zephryn Cochraine blow it with the romulans of remus.

chakotay definitely worst first officer right poss spoilers also ranting,"I've been slowly making my way through the ST franchise for the last decade (finished TNG DS9, haven't finished TOS, VOG and ENT), but I've never really been active in the fandom and I'm not sure what the consensus is on this eggplant of a character. But, I mean, I just dont think that there are any contenders. 

I'm still making my way through VOG, but I feel one of the many problems the show has is characters. Besides Tuvok, The Doctor and Janeway the cast is all very bland... but its Chakotay who I just actively hate. 

Because it's just.. like, you expect a First Officer to fill a void right? 

With Kirk being such an emotional and instinctual leader, Spock in theory can keep him grounded by offering an alternative, coldly factual perspective on how to handle a situation. Picard is this larger-than-life, highly decorated Starfleet legend who might often seem a little daunting to approach for the typical ensign, so by having the very personable and friendly Riker (spends more time playing poker with his crew than ordering them around) as his First, we get a kind of buffer between the average joe and the intimidating captain. For Sisko, Kira being a kind of First Officer was not only handy because she was a functional liasion to the Bajoran people for Starfleet, but she served as a constant reminder to him about what the high and lofty standards/ideals of the Federation actually mean to the on-the-ground people who are effected by them. She was like cold water in his face. So, yeah, voids are filled by First Officers. 

Now, what void exactly is Chakotay filling for Janeway? What is she capable of doing as Captain that she would not be capable of doing without Chakotay? 

 I mean, there was the whole Marquis thing and you can argue that he serves as a kind of mouthpiece for the Marquis half of Voyager... but that shit pretty much stopped being relevant after the first half of season 1 iirc. The Marquis doesn't matter most of the time. As of season 4 (what I'm up to right now), Chakotay pretty much agrees with everything Janeway says, and the few times he disagreed, his way of doing things was shown to be ineffective (Borg season 3 finale) or just not mattering (Year in Hell pt 1 and 2). He adds nothing. 

And even looking at it outside of expected role fulfillment in First Officers, he just falls flat for me as a character. The actor just completely sucks the life out of every scene he's in. I never imagined a guy with a face tattoo can ever be accused of being boring. I don't get what energy he's supposed to be giving off. Is he dangerous? Is he solemn? Is he fucking alive? 

And okay, apart from being former Marquis and an ineffective First, what else does Chakotay have going for him. Ah yes, the totally awkward and really out-of-place mysticism angle. I know my atheism is showing with this, and I do think that there is a way to do religion/faith/spirituality in ST right (DS9 is my favorite ST series so far), but a lot of the times Chakotay's spiritual-centric episodes felt so reductive on a show all about dispelling superstition and embracing the truth about our universe. Thankfully, it seems like VOY gave up on this angle after season 2. Hopefully they did anyway. 

And you have to believe me, I WANT to like characters. I am looking for a reason to like Chakotay but I just don't see it. 

I'm sure there was an in-universe reason why the infinitely more interesting and more useful Tuvoc got passed over for First officer, but I have to imagine that at a writer's table in the mid 90's, some guy was like ""Tuvok is the First right?"" and another guy said ""yeah, he'd be good, but we already had a Vulcan as First Officer in the first series so we can't do that again. Gotta go with the Marquis guy."" Fuck.

watched visitor sorry say like much thought would,"I'd heard so much about this episode as one of the best in DS9 and Trek. And I don't mind this kind of one off story which isn't about aliens/scifi at all. 'The Inner Light' is by far my fav episode.

I was really hoping to be blown away and wasn't. The story is good but it seems to be it lacks the depth and emotional impact of TIL. And I think a large part of that has to do with both Benjamin and Jake Sisco's actors acting. I just didn't buy their emotional involvement or the way they cried etc - it seemed forced and like it was being acted.

The high point of the episode and the thing that holds it together is Tony Todd and he really is head and shoulders above both the Sisco's.

And if I can compare to TIL once more, every since side character in that one - from the wife (a true standout) to Batai to his son (played by his real son) is so memorable and adds to the story but in the Visitor its only Tony Todd.

tas time trap amp voy void,"I find it hard not to speculate that *The Void* was inspired by *The Time Trap.* 

In *The Time Trap,* the Enterprise crew get sucked into the Delta Triangle, an area of space that acts as a pocket in time. Time travels extremely slow there and there are no stars. Therein lies a bunch of other trapped ships. A peaceful society has been born in the time trap, centuries prior by those who have all become trapped. The dilithium reserves start decaying, and by Scotty's estamtes, they have two days to  attempt to leave. In order to break the barrier, the Enterprise has to team up with Kor and the Klingons by physically combining their ships and activating their Warp Drives at the same time.

In *The Void,* Voyager gets sucked into an area of space absent of all matter, and like the Delta Triangle, totally black as far as the eye can see. Also like in the Delta Triangle, other lost ships are in the void. Instead of a peaceful co-operative society, the Void houses an Alliance driven war zone, where lost ships prey on less fortunate and less able-bodied ships. The big difference is that the Void is home to a native species that prey off of the lost ships by stowing away on them and eating their reserves/sabotaging their technology. Again, in order to break the barrier, Voyager crew has to team up with three other ships by combining and sharing technologies, and attempting to create a polaron modulator which will allow all of the to escape.

finished tng,"Well... I've finally done it. 

I have watched every episode of Star Trek: The Original Series, every episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation, and every Star Trek movie that exists. What a journey this has been. 

Specifically, I have just a moment ago finished the TNG finale, ""All Good Things"". I feel a bit strange right now... I've been in love with, addicted to and obsessed with Star Trek for years now. And now that I have completed arguably the two most iconic pillars of the franchise (TOS and TNG), I just feel... a bit sad. Like... no more watching **new** Star Trek after a hard day at college anymore. Any time I watch an adventure with Kirk or Picard from now on, its gonna be a repeat / an episode I've seen before. No more new TNG adventures await me, no! 

I don't know if this even makes sense, I'm fully aware that I am rambling right now. This is just a stream of consciousness, I guess. I just wanted to jot down my feelings. What a fantastical journey this has been. I feel a sense of sadness that it is over... Of course in reality, the journey is not over, for I foresee plenty more new Trek in my future - I plan on beginning Deep Space 9 and the new Picard series once that's finally out, and I greatly look forward to both of those shows. But still... just knowing that I have no more new adventures to look forward to in the TOS and TNG style and with those lovely crews, I'm not sure... I just feel a bit sad. It's like watching your best friend grow up and drift away from you! 

Again, fully aware this is a ramble. Its late and I'm not thinking properly. I just wanted to wrote this down before going to bed. I love this franchise so much. My adventures with Captain Kirk and Captain Picard have brought me so much joy throughout the years. I look forward to everything that is to come. Adore, adore, adore this series, and I am so proud to call myself a Trekkie. I feel at home in this lovely little bubble we call the Trek fandom. 

I apologise for my soppy sentimentality, it's just that ""All Good Things"" was really quite good and it's got me reflecting on my Trek journey thus far and how much ST really means to me on a personal level. God knows what strong role models Kirk, Spock, Picard and Data have been to me throughout the years. Sounds sad to say, but the crew of the Enterprise have been the closest friends I've had in probably my whole life. Fully aware I'm talking about fictional TV characters here, but it's funny how close you can kind of develop a bond with people when you come home to watch them and their adventures after having a really crappy day at college, and they're always there for you. I'm probably coming across as very weird right now but all I'm saying is, this show has helped me through a lot of really tough times, and provided me with some really positive role models to look up to and aspire to be like some day. Ah this is too sappy,  I'm gonna shut up and call it a night now.  I apologise for the train of thought but I just wanted to get this all out.

In deep space 9 Sisko and company sacrificed so much to take a dominion ship back to the federation and it gave them so much more knowledge on the dominion and gave them an edge, wouldn’t that make sense for The federation in kirks era?

never liked b elanna torres,"IMO she was an unprofessional, annoying, condescending and acted like a child and a b1tch to put it bluntly. She's full of herself, rude to others, to the point of hitting other crew members, goes running behind Chakotay at the slightest hint of trouble (and Chakotay's chief purpose seems to be defending Maquis to Janeway and vice versa, before the writers simply gave up on the whole tension plot). 

Torres might be a good engineer, but in the immortal words of Proximo - 'you're good, but you're not that good' and would've been fired and sent off on any other ship/occasion. Even late into the series, she's whining about 7of9 being 'rude' which takes some nerve.

question tng amp ds voy uniforms,"Is there any logic behind why sometimes you see one and then the other? I've been watching DS9 currently and I don't see any logic behind it. Sisko arrives on DS9 with the traditional TNG style uniform and meets Miles who already wears the mostly black DS9 style uniform. Then later Sisko changes into one of those too. Meanwhile Picard in the DS9 pilot continues to wear his TNG uniform (and they continue to do so in TNG). So at this point I figured TNG style is for starships and DS9 style is for space stations. Thomas Riker's appearance, Worf's first appearance and the crew from the Lexington with Bashir's old rival support that.

Here's where I get confused. In Star Trek Generations the Enterprise crew is wearing both, Voyager uses the DS9 style uniforms and in DS9 I'm currently watching the two parter where Sisko is sent to earth cause of the changelings (Homefront &amp; Paradise Lost). He and all the Starfleet personnel wear the TNG style uniforms. 

I know it's a weird thing to notice but it's something that never really made sense to me. Is there any in-universe logic to it?",startrek,1572808339,Tom_Dynamite,6,6,True,2019-11-03

wesley crusher could worked occurring guest character like brien,"I've been watching TNG and just finished season 4, episode 9, ""Final Mission."" So Wesley has finally left the show. I think he was a fundamentally flawed character though. How do you integrate a kid into a show with all adults? If you do an adult story, he doesn't really fit it. And if you do a kid story, you can't really use any of the other characters. 

Season 1 was filled with lots of annoying ""Wesley saves the ship"" stories. I think they did well in season 2, which had a lot of coming of age type episodes for him. But after that in seasons 3 and 4, he got the Tasha Yar treatment of mostly being in the background and saying ""Aye, sir!"" So it's no wonder he wanted to leave.

I guess if he wasn't Gene Roddenbury's Gary Stu character, he would've been better as a reoccurring guest character.

rewatching early tng,"Recently, I began my first rewatch of TNG, and was considering just skipping to Season 3 since the first two seasons are considered bad by most, but for some reason I decided to restart from the beginning.

And honestly, a lot of early TNG isn't nearly as bad as most people make it out to be. While Seasons 3-7 are definitely better, there are still plenty of gems in Seasons 1-2. There are the obvious stand-outs like *Measure of a Man* and *Q Who?* but there are also other good episodes that slip beneath the cracks

I've always really liked *The Royale*. It wasn't the most philosophical Star Trek has ever been, but it was some good fun seeing our characters solve a strange mystery. Not to mention episodes like *Arsenal of Freedom*, *The Icarus Factor*, *Where Silence Has Lease*, and *Conspiracy*. All of which have good interactions between the crew and have them challenged in some physical or emotional way.

 And then there is *Heart of Glory*, which is one of my favorite Worf-centric episodes of the entire show. Anyway, I think TNG defined the characters very well in the first two seasons. We saw their values through traditional exploration episodes, and we saw lots of their hobbies in more laid-back episodes, which helped humanize them.

What are your thoughts on early TNG? Do you consider it worth rewatching? And is Tasha Yar an interesting character who **SPOILER** &gt;!was killed too soon !&lt;**SPOILER**, or is it just me?",startrek,1572840225,ggg375,24,39,True,2019-11-03

fundamentally impossible actually change history star trek,"Star Trek, like most science fiction, has often used time travel for its plots. While many of these events are based around the characters doing something stupid, and seemingly altering history, there is one common thread among all these stories that gives a pretty interesting look at the nature of time in the Star Trek universe. Specifically, that time can't actually be altered in any real way.

* Going all the way back to TOS  S1 we have the episode ""City of the Edge of Forever"", an episode were the gang goes back in time to 1930, and accidentally saves a women, which creates a new timeline where the Federation never came into power due to vastly different events on Earth. However, because they used the Guardian of Forever to go into the past, and come back, and because the Guardian is a being that exists outside of time, the Guardian is able to inform them of said change, and help them be able to fix it, creating a situation where the change never happened.
* In TOS S2 we have ""Assignment Earth"", where the crew goes back in time to 1968, and ends up accidentally getting in the way of Gary Seven's transporter beam. They eventually end up helping him stop humanity from destroying itself via accidental nuclear war. At the end of the episode Spock corrects Seven's assessment that the interference of the Enterprise crew was accidental, by pointing out that had they not been there, then the timeline they came from couldn't have existed, meaning they were always meant to be there.
* This is also true of STIV. Kirk and crew go back in time to steal some whales in order to stop the Whale Probe, as all the whales had gone extinct by their time. While Kirk manages to steal two whales, when they return there is no visible change in the future from their actions. One could argue that Kirk's actions helped facilitate the extinction of the whales in the first place, or that, since the whales were all going to die anyways, removing two of them would have changed nothing. Either way, nothing changes.
* This same holds true for TNG. In Yesterday's Enterprise the ENT-C gets thrown into an alternate future where the Federation and Klingon Empire are at war, but luckily Guinan is there to inform Picard that this isn't the right timeline, and they help the ENT-C go back to where it belongs, reverting the change.
* The same is true for First Contact. The Borg go back in time and attempt to assimilate Earth before it develops warp drive, but luckily the Enterprise gets caught in the temporal wake, and manages to stop the Borg. As we learn later in Enterprise itself, this is part of a larger predestination paradox where the Borg from First Contact manage to awaken during the NX era, and send the signal to the Delta Quadrant which is what drew the Borg to Federation space in the first place, and set into action the series of events in the first place.
* Moving on to DS9. Quark, Rom, and Nog, end up getting sent back in time and cause the Roswell Incident. Another situation where going back in time and mucking in things they shouldn't be there for actually creates the right timeline.
* Same with when Sisko and the gang get sent back in time to the Bell Riots, accidentally get Bell killed, and Sisko takes his place. Since Sisko and Bell look so much alike, its impossible to really know if it ever was Bell in the first place, and if Sisko actually changed anything, or just did what we was always destined to do.
* Moving into Voyager we have the case of Henry Starling and the timeship Aeon, where said timeship goes back in time to 1967, where Starling finds it, and ends up creating the microprocessor revolution from it. Something that, had it never happened, would make the Aeon's existence impossible. Another bootstrap paradox.
* We see the same with Annorax, where he spends ages altering time, only for it to end with his timeship, and all the changes he made, erased from time, reverting the timeline back to normal. Annorax also makes the curious comment that he feels like time is fighting against his attempts to change it, something to note for later.
* Going into Star Trek Enterprise, we OFC have the already mentioned Borg paradox, but we also have the entire Temporal Cold War situation, where  Daniels, and agent from the year 3050, helps Archer save humanity from the Xindi attack, something that is itself a paradox as his timeline couldn't exist unless said event happened. 
* Even in Star Trek Discovery S2, since it happens after Enterprise, and Enterprise can only happen if Daniels exists, and Daniels can't exist if Control wins and destroys all life in the galaxy, we can be fairly certain that all of the timelines crated by Gabrielle Burnham's use of the time suit to stop Control were nothing but temporary false futures that existed solely to work time into fixing itself. If Control ever actually won then Daniels couldn't exist, which means humanity would be destroyed by the Xindi, which means the Federation could never exist to make Control in the first place, repeat a la paradox.

There are only two exceptions to this, but even those are unlikely to be real exceptions

* The first is the actions of Admiral Janeway in Voyager's ""Endgame"". Admiral Janeway gets a device that allows her to go back in time, convince her younger self to use the Borg transwarp network to get home early, and deal a massve blow to the Borg. While this may seem like a change in the timeline sticking, the novels(admittedly non-canon) actually explain this by having Temporal Agents attempt to stop Janeway, only to be stopped themselves by Temporal Agents from fruther in the future coming back and telling them that Janeway's time travel was always part of the correct timeline. An assertion that is largely supported by all the other canonal uses of time travel.
* The second is with the Kelvin timeline, where Nero's incursion into ""the past"" creates an alternate version of the events of the TOS era. However, the Kelvin timeline is a separate quantum universe, whose history was the same as the Prime's up until that point, not an actual  extension of the prime universe's timeline. It was never actually the Prime universe, so Nero's incursion didn't actually ""change"" anything. Its also important to note that, in a line cut from the film, but kept in the novelization, and the comic book adaption IIRC, Prime Spock notes the statistical improbability of the crew of the Enterprise coming together in this new timeline, and suggests that time itself may be attempting to undo the damage caused by Nero's incursion. A hypothesis supported by Annorax's comments, as well as the large list of not-changes above. Also since Nero's incursion happened after the events of Enterprise, and Enterprise only works if Daniel exists, even after Nero ""changed"" things, they must end up in the same future regardless.

The problem with attempting to actually change history in the Star Trek universe is that the Star Trek timeline is a series of nested paradoxes, spanning from at least 1967, all the way to the year 3050, that could only happen if all the other paradoxes happen as well. So even if you somehow manage to break one of the paradoxes, the existence of the other paradoxes will force the timeline to correct itself to ensure the other paradoxes happen. Thus, it is fundamentally impossible to actually affect any sort of real or noticeable change within this period of time within the Star Trek universe. Which is why all attempts to do so fail, or get erased.",startrek,1572842289,TheSajuukKhar,16,7,True,2019-11-03

tos focused background characters,"I love TOS. It's one of my favorite shows ever and may very well be my favorite Star Trek series, even if the production value is more than a little dated. Still, the storytelling still holds up for the most part.

Of course, TOS focuses on a trio: Kirk, Spock, and Bones. But there are also lots of background characters that were mostly neglected. While the movies would later give more characterization to the senior bridge staff, they didn't get too much to do during the series, with the exception of Scotty, who was basically the fourth main character.

 Personally, I would've loved to see more Nurse Chapel. Majel Barrett is just such a charming actress and a welcoming presence in all of Star Trek.

trying figure star trek las vegas would worth going,"I really got into Star Trek this year in a big way. Years and years ago, I got into the Kelvin timeline flicks and watched TNG casually, but this year, I practically binged all of TOS, all 13 movies, and am watching Discovery on Blu Ray (eagerly awaiting Season 2 next week!). I'm also a big reader, and bought up a collection of about 25 original series tie-in novels that I'm working my way through. I've become really passionate about this show, and don't plan to stop there.

So I'm curious about going to ST:LV, because the only conventions I've been to were relatively small (500+ attendees) and centered around anime or multi-fandom fantasy/sci-fi stuff. The anime one attracted more kids and teens, whereas the multi-fandom one just didn't have a whole lot of what I was interested in, so I would like to see what going to a large-scale, Trek-centered con would be like.

Now, I'm not really into toys, props, costumes, meet and greets, or autographed ""whatevers,"" but I really enjoy talking/learning/reading about Star Trek, and I want to immerse myself in as much of the best parts of the fandom as possible.

We live in Tennessee, and would definitely need to save up for airfare, accommodations, food, and tickets. I'm not sure how much we'd need – I'm thinking maybe close to $1k per person – and I'm assuming we wouldn't be able to go for a year or two, since we'd have to save up for it.

think discovery really good show long forget star trek,"Like many, I was disappointed with season 1. Too flashy. Ornamenty Klingons. So many lights. A super advanced star ship no one in the future Star Trek universe had ever heard of. There were many things that made me scratch my head. It was entertaining... but that's not what Star Trek is about. I resisted watching sesaon 2 for a long time but I finally swallowed my pride and gave it a chance. I did however do one thing different. Within the first 2 episodes I found myself being moved and immersed in what was happening. I didn't like that that was happened because the base ""Star Trek"" elements weren't there. It was still the flashy, keep-the-audience-visually-and-emotionally-engaged-at-all-times style from season 1. Albeit with better writing and better pacing. The solution to this conundrum I came up with was to just watch the show as if it was it's own stand alone creation. Not Star Trek or canon with any other part of it.... and it worked!! Season 2 was actually quite well done. The production quality is obviously top end. As was season 1. The performances were VERY good. Particularly from Sonequa Martin-Green, but everyone. The writing was much better and a lot of the scrath-your-head holes from season 1 were decently filled by the end of season 2. 

So although it takes a pretty strong suspension of disbelief to just ignore the Starfleet insignias and the familiar characters, once I was able to successfully block that out, I actually really enjoyed season 2 a lot and am really looking forward to season 3.",startrek,1572915069,sage_006,25,0,True,2019-11-04

First, Sisko is promoted to captain seemingly without any need for testing. I was under the impression earning captain required passing rigorous testing program/command school?

Second, they seem to introduce the concept of non-comms. I was under the impression all Starfleet officers are academics/subject specialists and that attending Starfleet academy isn't required. There are also a number of crew members on the defiant who have a no-pip rank less than ensign. How would one get into Starfleet without attending Starfleet academy? I understand Starfleet academy is relatively prestigious and difficult but In a world where education is presumably free why would anyone not go to Starfleet academy?

question changelings appearance,"Here with another deep thought about Trek! I’ve been watching some DS9 lately and wondered why the other changelings have the same appearance as odo when they assume and humanoid form. The reason why odo looks different is because he isn’t super skilled at shapeshifting so his appearance will always be a little off, but why the other changelings? In that series of episodes where the changelings infiltrated earth one (or many) were able to assume the exact same form as another human. I guess it comes down to practice as odo even said himself in regards to the accuracy of the form. For example in the episode children of time where the crew sees their Descendants, odo looks less “off” because he had hundreds of years to perfect it. But then again It (presumably) didn’t take the changeling on earth hundreds of years to perfect a human form. My overall question is why don’t the changelings choose to look like how future odo did in the children of time rather than just like odo?",startrek,1572980455,thotgor_is_a_breen,20,2,True,2019-11-05

There is also ""Killing Games"" (VOY, Episode 4x18): unlike the abominable Enterprise episode with the Nazis, this one is interesting: the set is extraordinary, the explosion of the gestapo building has not aged, and the Hirogen take a real psycholigic thickness with the very good character: Karr.

geeky grandmother eulogy,"I want to tell you all about someone special to me that just left this world tonight. The Dads always get the credit for being cool and geeky but in my family, the geekiest of them all was my grandmother, a great grandmother to my son. I was born on the day of her 42nd birthday, the first grandson.

My grandmother Joan was a real plain speaking woman who wasn't afraid to swear in public, much to the embarassment of her family at times. She liked a beer and in her 80's she took up smoking saying ""What's it going to do ? Kill me ? Hah, I'd like to see it try""

As I child I remember playing in her gigantic two storey house that was full of glass display cases containing replica ships including tiny crew, something her first husband was into. She had marigolds in the front yard and those swans that you made by cutting and painting old tyres and put plants into. Her house was directly across the park from the local primary school that I attended briefly. I used to make it my daily mission to be good at the end of the day in order to be let out of class early, running full pelt across the park, too fast for the magpies to swoop me to see if I could get there before the Sesame Street theme song started.

I didn't know my grandmother was such a geek until much later in life. We'd briefly discussed Star Trek when I was in my 30's and she'd made a big point of saying ""I'm not into all that Star Wars mumbo jumbo. Star Trek had real stories and real men in them"". Not exactly sure why she didn't think Harrison Ford was as much of a man as William Shatner but I was behind her all the way because I didn't give a fig about Star Wars either and I admired her conviction.

It was later in her 80's when she moved to our town that I really got to know her better and realised just how deeply into Star Trek she really was. I mean she had EVERYTHING. Every book, every movie and every episode from every series. She said ""You've seen TOS right ?"" and I said ""Oh yeah, saw it on TV plenty of times"" and she said ""No, you need to watch it again. Here, I have the DVD's. I'll lend you a few every week and you can tell me which episodes you liked the most"". It was almost like a quiz. She knew her lore so well that I could recount an episode to her and she'd say ""Oh yes, that was the one where Kirk met that lady who turned out to be ..."" and she'd go off on an intimate recounting of it as if she'd been the one who just watched it yesterday.

Voyager was where she really got me. I'd never seen Voyager. She said ""I'm not such a fan of the woman captain, but story is very good. It's ongoing. Tell me what you think of this one"" and she lent me all of Voyager, bit by bit. I spent a whole summer just watching all the old Star Trek from TOS, to TNG, Voyager, even DS9 which she sort of lost me on but even she agreed it was a bit rambling but still had its merits.

I tried to get her into Enterprise but she couldn't handle the ""young"" captain, Scott Bakula. I rememer being at the pub one day downing a pint with her on her 86th or 87th birthday saying ""Do you remember him as Sam Beckett from Quantumn Leap ?"" and she stretched back in her chair for a moment and said ""He had the hologram friend, right ?"" You got it grandma. She might not remember where she left her garage door remote sometimes, but she could tell you the plot of any sci-fi ever made.

The one that blew me out the most was on her second to last birthday, we were out for fish and chips and a pint at the pub as we did every birthday and out of nowhere she said ""What do you think about Stargate ?"" I replied ""Oh, the first series was great, but I think it just went a bit silly in later series and I didn't get it anymore. It's so long ago though that I saw it, I barely remember the plot of the first one"", and to the amazement of everyone at the table she continued ""It was that Anderson fellow that played Jack"" and went on over a full ten minutes to describe the plot of the first episode of SG-1 as if she'd just seen it yesterday. I asked ""How long since you saw that grandma ?"" and she said ""Oh, years. I have it on VHS somewhere. Do you want to borrow it ? It's very good"".

If I have half as many wits and memories about me when I'm 60 as she had at 90 I'll be pretty damn happy with myself. I'll always picture her sitting on the verandah at my parent's house, a beer in front of her, just staring off into the distant sky wistfully saying softly ""Yes... I'd like to go into space"".

Nan, I wish I could send your ashes into space but you always said you didn't want anyone to make a big fuss about you when you're gone and since you know as well as any scientist that all the atoms in the universe will travel through space endlessly, now that you're at rest you finally will be ... In space.

worf star trek picard,"I am wondering if anybody else has thought of this, as this has been bugging me for a bit:

If Worf appears in Picard what will he look like? Will he look like the classic Klingon we all know and love or will he look like the new style Klingons that appear in Discovery? I have not watched Discovery yet so I don't know the details of why they look the way they do (if there is an explanation).

I can see it going one of three ways:

1. Worf looks like classic Worf.
2. Worf looks like the new style Klingons and maybe alienates a portion of the fanbase.
3. This is a non-issue due to the recent re-merging of CBS/Paramount thus ignoring the old agreements about things being 25% different or whatever.

I can also see this being a non-issue as we don't know if Dorn is even going to appear in Picard, especially with the expense of doing all that makeup for what would essentially be a cameo.

menagerie journey babel better run episodes star trek,"I've often wondered that question. This might be a controversial opinion depending on your view of TOS. TNG is my favorite series but I can't think of a run of quality episodes to match it. 

In my opinion the weakest episodes in the run are ""The Squire of Gothos"" and ""The Alternative Factor"" which I personally don't hate as much as others.

And while I stopped at Journey to Babel I don't dislike Friday's Child but I've always viewed that episode as a better bookend for the run because it's of the same quality of the Menagerie.

klingons cardassians genetically disposed towards aggression cultural thing,"Both species have done some pretty bad things: the Cardassians had the Occupation of Bajor and the Klingons were at war with the Federation and their culture is pretty warlike.

Then again, as Kirk, Picard, Janeway, and many other characters would be the first to point out, we humans have done some bad things too (like World War II for instance and):

* Not all humans are the same: some are good, some are bad, most are in between.
* We've improved.

Also, Be'Lanna claims that the idea that all Klingons are aggressive is a stereotype, yet she also is pretty fiery and blames it on being half-Klingon and when she's split into her human and Klingon sides, her human side isn't fiery.

Worf was raised by humans and is viewed by other Klingons as a sissy, yet he likes to play fighty games too (like sparring with bat'leths). Then again, this could simply be due to finding his culture very important.

Back to Cardassians, there was this one drug that ""expanded the xenophobia of Cardassians"". Does that imply that all Cardassians are xenophobic or would a significantly non-xenophobic be immune (much like how Stamets and Hugh would probably be immune to Orion slave girls)?

Also, Seska's a nasty piece of work, but she never really seems prejudiced. So what's the deal with Klingons and Cardassians?",startrek,1573103168,OptimisticTrekkie,11,6,True,2019-11-07

thinking trek late,"Just some thoughts had run in my mind about Star Trek and JJ Abramas Trek and Discovery hand in hand are pretty smart on how they done their storylines. In Star Trek (The Movie) the Narada shows up and destroys the Klingon Fleet, the same one that the Discovery was going to tangle into before the end of Star Trek Discovery Season 1, in the movie this doesn't happen though because the Klingon Fleets gone so there is no war to take place.  So with this we can see the affects of the various timelines between the shows.

Now onto Star Trek Picard, been watching the trailers and seen that some of the people on Youtube are a bit wrong, my opinion is that girl who comes up to Picard isn't his daughter or anything like people say, she comes to him because he's Locutus, or was Locotus and that everything 'inside her' (voices?) tell her that she'll be safe with him. That place as well where we see so many days without assimulations is on that Borg Cube as well.

theory klingons lose lot fights humans,"So I have been thinking about this a lot lately.  Why would a warrior race lose a lot of hand to hand fights with humans, which aren't as highly trained or even as strong (besides not wanting to kill off main characters and the obvious plot devices)? The answer comes down to strength vs. speed.  

My theory boils down to this: Klingons have been selectively breeding to become bigger and stronger for a very long time.  Think about their fight style and duels.  They are pretty strait forward, face to face, and come down to who can over-power who.  So what would Klingon women find attractive? The stronger male and not the faster one.  It is considered honorable to be face to face and fight head on.  While they have their little dance beforehand rituals, there isn't  a lot of movement and dodging, more deflection and counter-attacking.  Using your strength to absorb and deflect their blow and striking when they are off balance.

Why does this matter? Well think how humans fight.  They are going to take any advantage they can and what would humans have that Klingons don't? Speed! Humans are going to use their speed to deliver their (sometimes fatal) blow.  So it may take a Klingon to recover a split second longer then a human which in a fight is almost an eternity.  

Maybe this is something that has been discussed on here or a novel.  I just thought it was worth a thought.",startrek,1573158445,XThrtLvLMidNiteX,42,1,True,2019-11-07

It's clear that Star Fleet saw XO of the Enterprise as a pipeline for up and coming officers to be given commands of their own. They tried several times to promote Riker. They tried to move Shellby into his place. However he stubbornly held on to his position ten years longer than anyone would expect. 

There were a few people on board who may have been eligible for the role. Data, La Forge, and Worf were all ""in the pipeline,"" so to speak. Crusher was eligible to command a medical ship, and troi was able to command the enterprise on occasion although that didn't seem to be her career goal.  

Data clearly had career ambitions, and was second officer, but he never had the opportunity to prove himself long-term as XO. 

La Forge (in one timeline) would move on to captain a ship, so he too had career ambitions toward command. 

Worf eventually had to make a lateral move to DS9 to move up in posting. 

The ship's science officer wasn't very ambitious and wasn't even included in many staff meetings. 

It was never clear to me why Riker wanted to stay. Defiance against his father's expectations? To stick around in case Diana developed feelings for him again? Comfort? The feeling that he could do more on the Enterprise than another ship?",startrek,1573277296,fleemfleemfleemfleem,37,1,True,2019-11-09
watching ds first time enjoying whole character concept dax comes confusing immorale,"Finished TNG and now Im up to S1 S7, so far so good! However I don't like Dax just on the whole character design regarding the dual host and Trill relationship. 

I cant get over how greatly immorale I find it for a lifeform to take over a hosts very being. To essentially take over the life of the host as if it's their own but only to absorb some knowledge and personality traits. Even setting that aside for a bit... 

They say it's a dual symbiotic relationship but Both beings don't at all seem to be in equally recognised. Dax, the Trill is the one they refer to ""them"" as. Where is this dual relationship if it's only the Trill they are talking to? 

But where does this leave The host, Jadzia anyway? Is their consciousness completely wiped out? Or blended? If Blended her being talked to as just the Trill doesn't make sense.  The host seems to come off as a mere meat puppet from my perspective. Since the only part of Jadzia that is recognised is the gender. 

It's confusing for me and comes off as unnecessary complexity. Will the show ease my concerns of this subject? I have my doubts since I'm far down the rabbit hole on the subject already.  Or is there something I'm missing here?",startrek,1573277863,KnLfey,18,1,True,2019-11-09

long idea star trek story love turn book scared bit rubbish please get feedback synopsis,"The timeline is a few decades after the events in Nemisis and the destruction of Romulus and the collapse of the Romulan empire. The federation and Klingon empire are weak after so many wars, there is civil war and constant fighting from Romulan space spilling over into federation and Klingon territories, and criminal organisations are increasingly a match for thinly stretched and overworked federation and Klingon starships. 

The story begins as a data, in a new body with seemingly human skin gasps for breath and sees an old woman sitting in front of him. The last thing he remembers is downloading his brain into b4. She explains that she is the great great granddaughter of Dr Soong and custodian of his work. She has created a new next generation body for Data with human like appearance and skin over an even stronger frame with increased emotional and mental abilities. Data's consciousness has been recovered with all memories intact and transferred from a now dismantled B4 who resides in a glass case on a wall like a display. He was never ""alive"" she says, he was simply the custodian of you katra if you like.

She explains that he is the first of a whole new race envisioned by Dr Soong. The ""eternans"" (eternal androids). That he intended for the eternans to be the benevolent ""custodians of the universe"", holding together the fabric of peace and cohesion where organics can only inevitably fail by their imperfect design and selfish desires. 

She explains that with data she has finally completed Dr Soongs work, and they are now able to create others, billions of individual eternans of all appearances, personalities and genders committed to Dr Soongs goal. 

To start their mission, she has decoded a Romulan intelligence disk revealing the location of a secret well resourced Tal Shiar facility where they made and tested next generation starships. She said that she and Data would go there to recover the star empires last Romulan warbird, and create a crew to man it.

I even hear Marina Sirtis's praises get sung on occasion which is good because she's an underrated actress.

But I don't hear anybody talk about Levar Burton as LaForge. I feel like he out of all of the TNG players might have been the most consistently good. Even Patrick Stewart had the odd misstep (I know its heresy to say that) perhaps because he was given more challenging material. 

But Levar Burton you could tell was always giving it 110%. He had so much energy and enthusiasm it was infectious and that's no small feat given the demands of the TNG working schedule.

I just feel like he always turned in a rock solid performance and where sometimes you could tell Patrick Stewart was ACTING Levar Burton came off more natural.

tng borg figure captain individuality,"After abandoning his original plan to infect the Borg with a paradox, Picard hits on the idea that simply allowing the Borg to reassimilate Hugh will transmit the sense of individuality he's acquired throughout the collective. 

Say what now Captain? 

Aren't the Borg exposed to individuality every time they assimilate people into the collective? Even if most Borg are grown, they assimilated Picard and Seven of Nine. Did their sense of individuality not infect the collective?

And yet we'll see indeed that for some reason this works. In ***Descent*** a bunch of Borg have been turned into individuals thanks to Hugh.

I guess since Hugh is already Borg they don't do the quarantine and personality scrub that they do on individuals being newly assimilated.

feel prophets franchise,"TNG basically portrayed all religion as false except Native American spiritual practices for some reason. If you're an atheist I imagine this was the series you're most comfortable with. You probably liked episodes like ""Who Watches the Watchers."" 

Then came Deep Space Nine and the revelation that the Prophets of the Bajoran religion were basically real. There was certainly something real inside that wormhole that the Bajorans were worshipping. Their Orbs worked, their prophecies tended to come true. The Bajoran religion is basically true in the context of the show. 

In fact its kind of strange given the evidence that more of the starfleet crew doesn't worship them. Atheists are as they are in real life due to a lack of evidence of the divine. I think most wouldn't continue to be atheists if there was a living Emissary to God, artifacts (orbs) that give you experiences with God, and a place you could actually go where God hangs out.

So Deep Space Nine flipped Star Trek on its head in a lot of ways, being stationary, having more continuity between episodes, having non Starfleet make up much of the cast, and having a religion turn out to be real.

finally watched enterprise,"I have had some free time on my hands recently so I am finally watching Enterprise after never giving it a go when it came out.

I do not regret my original decision and even feel a bit like I should have stuck to it.

Episodes particularly early on just went through the motions of recycling plots and stories from past series.

Others relied on riffing on previous series events and aliens like the Ferengi and Borg episodes, Archers trial on Qonos recreating whole shots and scenes from Undiscovered Country, Brent Spinners guest appearance – he should have just been an original character because ending with an allusion to Data just cheapens it.

The 'temporal cold war' was poorly developed, it was clearly just cooked it up to create a hook for the pilot and after that they had no idea what to do with it or where to go and just invoked it whenever a plot development was needed.

The tonal shift in the show as different producers and story editors came and went each season trying to retool and revive the show is also very noticeable. From typical Star Trek stand alone episodes of season 1-2, to trying to duplicate BSG in season 3, to deep lore in season 4. It grew disconcerting.

The Xindi attack was apparently meant to be an analogy for 9/11 and the GWOT, I guess I can see that and to their credit they handled the Xindi even handedly as a people with real motivations rather than being two dimensional villains. But they also had Archer successfully torturing someone. Torture has been featured in the past in Star Trek as something used by depraved villains and despotic regimes and we know in real life that torture does not work. Yet Archers effort worked just fine, he was ashamed of it but it worked. What kind of moral message does that send? Thats the sort of message the CIA would have us believe about their own efforts. Have Cardassian or Andorian efforts at torture been successful? Do Archers noble intentions make the difference - Cardassians and Andorians would argue their intentions were just.

To be consistent with the morals presented throughout Star Trek, not to mention reality, that should not have been done. It should have been depicted as providing no information or simply telling Archer what he wanted to hear to make it stop – that is the reality of torture as seen in the US Senates report on CIA torture, that it was [ineffective in generating intelligence](https://www.newsweek.com/torture-report-movie-cia-waterboarding-senate-enhanced-interrogation-guantanamo-detainees-1470223).

Particularly egregious was the awful sexual exploitation of the T'Pol character. Putting her in form fitting catsuits or skimpy undergarments and pyjamas bearing her cleavage and midrift, which she continued to wear even after joining starfleet but now with the ridiculous addition of a patch on the arm and rank on the shoulder. And the obnoxious ""titillating"" decontamination and massage scenes. Who was responsible for this, a 12 year old boy? Who did they think it would appeal to?

The relationship with Trip also wasn't believable, it simply didn't develop or show any reason for interest by either side and instead just happened.

I also found something very odd about the casting. Have a look at DS9 and Voyager: they had a very diverse multi-racial and gender cast. But have a look at Enterprise: all white guys, there is just 1 black guy and 1 asian woman. Which was not helped by the guy being a bad actor and the womans character being a shrinking violet, or that both were often given marginal roles. What's up with that?

I like the idea of an early years series, I liked some of things they did, I liked Dr Phlox being a change of pace from how such characters usually behaved.

But overall the people making this had some bad/tired ideas and no clear concept of what they wanted to do, maybe there were too many people in charge, maybe there was too much network or studio interference.",startrek,1573449910,Lamont-Cranston,77,1,True,2019-11-11

voyager episode timeless two part season finale season opener ala best worlds,"I was watching Timeless and although I liked it a lot, I feel it would have been much better as a two part episode spread across the finale of one season and the opener of the next. The finale could have taken place in the Voyager's present day, with them perfecting, installing, and testing the slipstream drive and then ending with the ship unexpectedly crashing onto the planet and being destroyed. Imagine the build up to the finale, implying that they're finally going to make it home, and then BAM, out of nowhere the episode ends with the ship crashing and everyone dying as Kim and Chakotay fly on, completely dismayed and horrified. Talk about an unexpected finish that leaves fans dying to know what will happen next. That would have been a hell of a cliffhanger just as shocking as Best of Both Worlds TNG. 

And then the second part opener would follow Kim and Chakotay 15 years later as they are fugitives from the Federation and their journey to aquire what they need in order to effectively send a message back through time to stop Voyager's destruction. That in and of itself would make for one hell of an exciting season opener. And then when it's all said and done and the episode ends with Voyager being saved.....man, what a journey from season to season.

His mother was a homemaker. His father, born in Belfast, was a pharmacist, veterinarian and dentist, and a member of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland. William Doohan owned a chemist shop in Main Street in Bangor, beside Trinity Presbyterian Church. Doohan's father reportedly invented an early form of high-octane gasoline in 1923. Doohan's 1996 autobiography recounted his father's serious alcoholism. Doohan's paternal grandfather, Thomas Doohan, was Head Constable in the Royal Irish Constabulary. 

The family moved from Vancouver to Sarnia, Ontario. Doohan attended high school at the Sarnia Collegiate Institute and Technical School (SCITS), where he excelled in mathematics and science. He enrolled in the 102nd Royal Canadian Army Cadet Corps in 1938. 

At the beginning of the Second World War, Doohan joined the Royal Canadian Artillery and was a member of the 14th (Midland) Field Battery, 2nd Canadian Infantry Division. He was commissioned a lieutenant in the 14th Field Artillery Regiment of the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division. He was sent to England in 1940 for training. 

The first Canadians reached Juno Beach at 7:35 AM and were cut down. Fortunately for them, the HMS Ajax had bombed Juno earlier, doing more damage to the coastal defenses than the planes had. After two hours, they had swept aside most of the Germans on their stretch of the beach. 

Doohan led his men across the sands and got lucky. Despite the anti-tank mines beneath their feet, none went off, as the men were not heavy enough to activate them. As they made their way to higher ground, Doohan managed to take out two German snipers – his first kills of the war. 

By noon, they had secured their positions. They could rest, as well as deal with their dead and wounded. There was, however, a problem. 

Although Doohan escaped the initial moments of the invasion relatively unscathed, his luck didn’t last: 

At about 11:20 that evening, Doohan finished a cigarette and patted the silver cigarette case he kept in his breast pocket. It had been given to him by his brother as a good luck charm… and a good thing, too. 

Some ten minutes later, he was walking back to his command post when he was shot. Six times. By a Bren Gun. The first four bullets slammed into his leg, the fourth whacked him in the chest, while the sixth took off his right middle finger. 

It was not a German sniper. He had been shot by a nervous, trigger-happy Canadian sentry. Fortunately, the cigarette case stopped the bullet aimed at his chest. Doohan later joked it was the only time being a smoker saved his life.  

When speaking about the experience James Doohan said the following “We landed safely, thank God, through those Y-shaped steel barriers you see in the film (Saving Private Ryan), tracer bullets, all that, none of our men hurt, and dashed 75 yards to the 7-foot tall dunes,” Doohan said.  

“Crossed a minefield, found out about it later: It was meant to blow up tanks, and we weren’t heavy enough. Moved up through a down – hardly a town just a village – called Graye Sur Mer, saw a church tower that was a machine-gun post, firing off to our left.  

Doohan took out the machine-gun post with a couple of shots. “I don’t know if they were killed or wounded, but it shut them up,” he said.  

His mother was told that German bullets had hit him at 11:30 p.m. on D-Day as he was returning from a forward gun position. He walked a quarter-mile – “the adrenaline lets you do it” – to the regimental aid post, Doohan said. He knew about his right hand and the whack on his chest against that cigarette case, but that was all. 

The medic said ""You also have four bullets in your left knee."" To which Doohan replied: ‘Well, I walked here.'” 

Doohan graduated from Air Observation Pilot Course 40 with eleven other Canadian artillery officers and flew Taylorcraft Auster Mark V aircraft for 666 (AOP) Squadron, RCAF as a Royal Canadian Artillery officer in support of 1st Army Group Royal Artillery. All three Canadian (AOP) RCAF squadrons were manned by artillery officer-pilots and accompanied by non-commissioned RCA and RCAF personnel serving as observers. 

Although he was never actually a member of the Royal Canadian Air Force, Doohan was once labeled the ""craziest pilot in the Canadian Air Force"". In the late spring of 1945, on Salisbury Plain north of RAF Andover, he slalomed a plane between telegraph poles ""to prove it could be done""—earning himself a serious reprimand.  

After the war, he returned to Canada where he heard a radio drama. Believing he could do a better job than the voice actors, Doohan took up drama and earned a scholarship to New York City. 

His first job was with CBC radio on January 12, 1946. He would go on to do 4,000 shows on radio, 450 on TV, and earn a reputation as the most versatile voice actor in the business. 

It was in 1965, however, that he indeed entered history when he landed the role of Montgomery “Scotty” Scott in Star Trek. As well as playing the role of Chief Engineer for the Starship *Enterprise*, Doohan also helped develop the Klingon and Vulcan languages. 

He became so iconic that fans credit him with their interest in engineering, astronomy, and other technical fields. Among these was the engineer-turned-astronaut, Neil Armstrong, who personally thanked Doohan in 2004. 

Doohan died in 2005. To honor him, the SpaceLoft XL rocket took some of his ashes into space. Two years later, the Scottish town of Linlithgow claimed him as one of their own with a predictive commemorative plaque. “Predictive,” because it claims he will be born there on 2222. 

Thank you for your service James Doohan, and for everything after. You will be remembered along with hundreds of thousands of other brave men and women this Monday at the Eleventh Hour, of the Eleventh Day, of the Eleventh Month.  

I encourage all who read this to go out this today, buy a poppy, wear it proudly and attend a local Remembrance Day ceremony and be sure to remember those lost in the service to their nations every day of the year.

question regarding watch order tos first time watcher,"I can assume that a question like this one has been asked many times before but I would like to make sure that I don't miss a single scene so, here I go:

&amp;#x200B;

I have started watching Star Trek on Netflix and didn't know that I should have skipped the Pilot episode. Thus I was really confused as I progressed through the season. Then I read that 'The Menagerie' episodes would make things clear for me. I am currently more than halfway through the first part and the salvaged scenes from the pilot episode have just begun. Would I miss any extra scenes if I were to skip over those scenes(since I've watched them like several days ago and remember them pretty well)? Do the scenes continue on to the second part?(I didn't check because I didn't want to be spoiled should they don't.) 

What are your suggestions?",startrek,1573484592,Issei_mert,5,1,True,2019-11-11
brien bashir best friendship irish english served proof cardassian bajoran people could one day heal relationship perhaps even friends,"I think if any Bajoran or Cardassian happened to research the history of Earth and then put one and two together, it may have been enlightening. Kira has some knowledge of Ireland as she mentions it to O'Brien in one or two episodes. But, here we have two members of two Earth ethnic groups who very much had a similar relationship at one time to the Cardassian and Bajoran people. Even though the major inspiration of the Bajoran's are the Jews being exterminated in WW2 A lot of Bajor very much resembles Ireland as a whole throughout history. You had men like Charles Trevelyan who was a powerful British politician who had sway in Ireland, whose views were very much parallel a certain Cardassian Gul. 

 ''**If the Irish once find out that there are any circumstances in which they can get free government grants, we shall have a system of mendicancy \[begging\] such as the world never knew”. After a million had starved to death he stated** ''**The judgement of God sent the calamity to teach the Irish a lesson, that calamity must not be too much mitigated, the great evil with which we have to contend is not the physical evil of the famine, but the moral evil of the selfish, perverse and turbulent character of the people.'' - Charles Trevelyan**

**'' You can’t trust the Irish, they are all liars''  -Margaret Thatcher**

**''The Irish hate our order, our civilization, our enterprising industry, our pure religion. This wild, reckless, indolent, uncertain and superstitious race have no sympathy with the English character. Their ideal of human felicity is an alternation of clannish broils and coarse idolatry. Their history describes an unbroken circle of bigotry and blood'' -**  **Disraeli.** 

Then you have a similar quote with elements of the above quotes by Gul Dukat.

 **''Of Course I hated them! I hated everything about them! Their superstitions, and their cries for sympathy, their treachery and their lies. Their smug superiority and their stiff-necked obstinacy. Their earrings, and their broken, wrinkled noses!''  I should have killed them all and turned their planet into a graveyard the likes the Galaxy has never seen -Gul Dukat** 

And centuries later we have two members of these two former enemies as best of friends on DS9, even today the relationship between the average English and Irishman is quite good.

really really love deep space nine,"...in later seasons, they started exploring the more supernatural/spiritual and religious side of Bajor, and for me it just cuts against the grain of everything that Star Trek is supposed to be about (eg, Science, logic, reason, rational explanations and theories).

When Sisko became the reluctant Emissary to the Bajorans, he did so to create a connection to the Bajoran people and legitimise the Federation's presence on DS9 and the sector; he called the Prophets ""Wormhole Aliens"" (which they are). It was all understandable and reasonable. Then he started believing he WAS the Emissary, started having ""visions"". And in the most recent episode, we are led to believe that Sisko was purposefully born from a merged prophet (alien) to be the Emissary.

So, when Picard shot the Borg with the Tommy gun, my friend said it killed them because the Borg drone's shields can't stop physical projectile weapons.

But I argued that they could.  

I said the only reason he was able to kill them was because they didn't have a chance to adapt to them yet.  If there had been more Borg there, he might have killed four or five, but they would have eventually adapted and been able to stop the bullets.

recently watched st enterprise fell love show starting season went full ds,"So I've long been a TOS and TNG loyalist, and I frequently clash with folk on here for my staunch view that those two shows represent the ""heart"" of what makes Star Trek great, specifically for my view that DS9 is a stark departure from these shows and, while it may make for great television, DS9 was not a great ""trek"" show.

I recently started to watch Enterprise after overlooking it on it's first run.  I was told not to expect much, but was promised the show got really good in season 3 and very good in season 4.  I started my binge with low expectations but was genuinely taken by how much I enjoyed seasons 1 and 2.  They were very much in the same vein as TOS and TNG in terms of a balance of military battles and moral quandaries.  I get why folk were annoyed at how many inconsistencies the shows has with TOS, but frankly I loved the ""first explorers"" theme of the show, and have really enjoyed getting to see how the Federation arose.

I started on season 3, expecting things to get better based on what I had heard ... and it opens with this multiple episode arc plot line about the Xindi and going into the Expanse.  I sadly expect that this isn't simply a multiple episode arc and may just be how seasons 3 and 4 play out, but either way it's been really disappointing.  Frankly it feels like the show did a hard flip from TOS and TNG (seasons 1 and 2) to DS9 - multiple arc episodes, more focused concentration on the captain (vs. his interactions with his crew mates), the focus on the ""enemy"" instead of exploration, much more military focused, etc.

My question is this - does anyone know why the show took a hard turn beginning Season 3?  What was the thought process or driving force behind the change?  Any insights into the actual decision making that took place (as opposed to hypotheticals?)",startrek,1573577415,IrishinManhattan617,6,1,True,2019-11-12

enterprise season finale pacing regards discovery,"Wanted to jot some thoughts regarding Ent S3 after finishing last night. Spoilers abound for both Enterprise and Discovery.


One thing that really surprised me about the finale was the pacing. A lot of modern shows, and specifically Discovery, feel very quick. The season builds up to the point where, as you close in on the last episode, you know there is no way they're resolving all of the main issues of the season before the end. 

With Enterprise, I felt like the show was coming up on the closer by Episode 18/24, and found myself curious what they were going to do to spill the story over 6 episodes. What we got was not a frantic rush to close the most important loops, but an interesting story with twists and plot. We felt the loss of characters (Degra), made friendships with new ones (Insects), had time for some light-hearted stories that weren't quite filler but with a deviating A-plot (time displaced Enterprise that had been hinted at through the season, focus on getting through the wormhole to meet rendezvous). 

We got a ton of plot out of something I thought was a pretty straightforward and linear story. The linearity gave us a serialized story similar to DS9's series finale, while still giving us many ""adventure of the week"" feels once we got past the first few episodes of the season. This season felt like the weakest of the Enterprise seasons I've seen so far while still giving us a sense of curiosity and intrigue. Some episodes felt very similar to TOS even.

My favorite episode of Discovery was the 2nd S1 episode with Mudd, and his time thingy. It was a self-contained episode about a single instance. The problem of the episode was solved due to the uniqueness and team-working of the crew, including some difficult to love characters (Stamets). It used the show's characters to move forward, and even tied into the main plot (Stamets' situation was the reason they were able to survive). This episode seemed to have it all.

Final thoughts: Have we gotten a Nazi episode of Discovery yet? Because it feels like a rite of passage for every Star Trek series to have a Nazi episode.",startrek,1573582129,ProtoJMan,8,1,True,2019-11-12

would voyager better made,"Star Trek: Voyager is a pretty fun show. It's far from my favorite Trek, but for what it is, it's enjoyable enough. It's got some of the best characters in the franchise (The Doctor, 7 of 9, Tuvok), it has an interesting plot, and it has Neelix, who is up there with Wesley Crusher and Sybok as being one of those characters Trek fans universally ~~hate with every fiber of their being~~ love, flaws and all

But with all its strengths, would the show come together more cohesively if it were made now? I think a problem brought up a lot with the show is how it couldn't really decide if it wanted to be episodic or not. Certain episodes were really intense and emotionally involving...only to pull a reset button (Year of Hell comes to mind. Excellent A+ episode outside of the last 5 mins, which undoes everything)

You could chalk up some of the reset button stuff up as being something the new network, UPN, probably requested. When starting a new network and having a flagship show, it is good to have that show be as accessible as possible to entrap new viewers, even if it means the show will not be as cohesive. I think this may be why certain episodes don't follow through plot-wise, like DS9 does for instance.

In the age of streaming where shows are more serialized and treated almost as really long movies, would Voyager have been even better? I personally think it might've. I think with a story like Voyager consistency really matters. It adds to the suspense of a federation vessel out in the middle of nowhere with limited supplies. While I like episodic Trek, and even prefer it in most cases, I think Voyager is a story that may have fared better had it been more serialized.

tng face enemy,"Everyone refers to this as the good Troi episode and it is. But that's not the only thing I like about it. 

What I appreciate is that its very easy to flip the perspective and see Troi as the villain and the Romulan Commander as the hero. 

She demonstrates morality throughout the episode and is only acting in the best interests of her crew. For the most part, she's only doing what the heroes would do in her position. The only time she deviates from that is when she decides to fire on the Enterprise if they prove they're able to track her ship while cloaked. 

From her perspective she has every right to see herself as the hero of the story and the story almost supports that. It helps that Troi is forced into playing the role of the villain which she does surprisingly well given how compassionate and empathetic she normally is. Its almost DS9-like, brings to mind the time Sisko played the villain to capture Eddington.",startrek,1573693209,Smooth_Complaint,16,1,True,2019-11-13

redditors love captain jellico much,"""Chain of Command""  S06 E10 and 11

I remember when I saw that episode for the first time in 1992 I thought it was an interesting experiment.   Enterprise is the Federation flagship, many of the crew graduated at the top of their class or distinguished themselves in some other way.   They were the best of the best of the best, or else they would be assigned to lesser ships. 

Except for occasionally dying horrible deaths, their *professional* lives are pretty sweet.   Picard treats them with respect.  They have meetings in the conference room where he goes around the room asking the opinions of everyone, including younger officers in their thirties, then seems to weigh their arguments carefully before making a decision.   You never see him degrade anyone just because he's angry that something went wrong.

What happens when you give all those outstanding officers a supervisor who Caine Mutiny-style, fixates on trivial stuff like Deanna's uniform.  He disrespectfully calls officers he just met by their first names like they're servants.  He orders arbitrary random shift changes, and then in the middle of an important negotiation, acts confident but looks like he's fucking the whole thing up.   He lets Riker know [he thinks he sucks](https://youtu.be/0kT79xCWQ8k) so he will probably write him up and damage his career if he questions anything.  Sorry crew, Riker can't save you.

Everybody has had a bad boss, or a crazy boss.  How will hothouse flower Enterprise officers survive?   Will they request immediate transfers?  Insubordination?  Resign their commissions in the middle of the mission?

captaining valiant adjust attack pattern inflict maximum damage whilst getting away one piece ish,"Mine:  

As a small, heavily armed and highly manoeuvrable opponent, maintain continuous fire with all weapons (Quantums torpedos/fore/aft, plus phasers fore/ventral) from max range, all the time zig-zagging sharply at highly randomized intervals to avoid incoming weapons fire.  This should favour me as the Dominion battleship will have far more difficulty landing direct hits than if I launch a frontal assault.  As depicted, pepper any and all areas with weapons fire, and AVOID deliberately targeting the braces with the initial conventional barrage; it is possible the Dominion are aware of the flaw, and we don't want tip our hand, lest they adjust accordingly.  When shields dip below 70%, or casualties exceed X (whatever that is), whichever is the sooner, position the Valiant so that the vulnerable underbelly is within inevitable reach of a frontal (albeit swerved) assault, implement the attack run down the trench for the port shaft (ahem) sorry, support braces.

Maintain zig-zag swerving on approach to the ""kill"" zone, but abandon attempts to conceal true target intent.  This will be by far the bloodiest phase as we are flying almost directly into their weapons fire, so we might as well go for broke.  Selectively target the braces with all frontal weapons BUT maintain fire on other areas with ventral phasers.  Once within 300m, launch the rigged torpedoes, but maintain both ventral phaser and aft torpedo fire during escape phase.  Position ship to stop just within aft torpedo range, and maintain fire into the cloud, readying Warp engines for rapid departure.  

If battleship sufficiently damaged, come about and finish the job.  

If not, engage Warp and GTFO.",startrek,1573749734,JAdoreLaFrance,7,1,True,2019-11-14

___

**Short Trek #7 - ""Ask Not""**

* At around nine minutes and fifteen seconds (including credits but omitting the previews), this is the shortest canon installment of Star Trek yet produced.
* The premise of the episode involves a cadet test simulation. These have cropped up before, most famously in the form of the no-win scenario Kobayashi Maru test from STII and ST2009. A pre-Academy ""psych test"" was administered to Wesley Crusher in ""Coming of Age."" The test in this episode gauged Sidhu's sense of duty and loyalty, which more closely echoes the command test given to Troi in ""Thine Own Self.""
* Sidhu wears the cadet insignia established with Tilly during DIS' first season. Tilly's presence on the Discovery sets the precedent for what appears to be either Academy graduates or upperclassmen being posted to deep space assignments, as Sidhu (and perhaps her husband) are here. Nog also served on the Defiant while an Academy cadet.
* Starbase 28 has not been referenced before, although subtitles in ""Choose Your Pain"" suggested it was the base seen in that episode.
* The USS Bouman is also a new reference. It's very very likely the ship was named after computer scientist Katie Bouman, part of the Event Horizons team which captured the first image of a black hole earlier this year.
* The supposed attack is carried out by the Tholians, a very skittish non-humanoid people seen in only two episodes but referenced often. Antagonistic in TOS and ENT, the web-spinning Tholians appear to have established diplomatic relations with the Federation by the 24th century.
* Sidhu survived a Tholian attack on Berellium. The Berellians were mentioned just once, in ""Redemption Part II,"" in the context of a people who are not especially good at handiwork. As Sidhu is an aspiring engineer it stands to reason she was there to help out.
* We are quoted Regulation 191, Article 14: ""when in combat, command falls to the vessel with tactical superiority."" This rule was introduced in ""Equinox.""
* After that, we get the Reserve Activation Clause (""an officer in good standing may reinstate a discharged officer in times of crisis or emergency""), which was exploited to ""draft"" McCoy back into service in TMP.
* Then, Directive 010: ""Before engaging alien species in battle, any and all attempts to make first contact and achieve nonmilitary resolution must be made."" First quoted by Janeway in ""In the Flesh.""
* Annnnnd finally Pike cites Regulation 208, Paragraph 2, which was first referenced in...oh, that one's new.
* The Enterprise's engine room is seen. The visual redesign here seems to borrow very little from the TOS version, instead featuring an apparently vertical warp core and a spacious expanse more reminiscent of the ""brewery"" engine room from the Kelvin films.",startrek,1573780330,Antithesys,8,1,True,2019-11-14

I really like how the crew is partially thrown together from Starfleet's rejects and criminals- Paris, Chakotay, and Torres are great counterpoints to the best-of-the-best elites of the TNG crew. Janeway is a fantastic captain. I love the Doctor's journey to think of himself as a person and not just a tool of convenience. I even like Neelix and Kes. I overall love the feel of a crew that's thrown together by circumstance.

So my question is...does it get worse? Because it feels like this is the show people always complain about as never rising to its potential. I've heard that the Trek format started to feel tired during Voyager.",startrek,1573788097,Pervazoid2,52,1,True,2019-11-14

His earrings look like one of those colored shard 1970s lamps, if anyone knows the kind I mean. Mudd is the trashiest guy ever.

That's all really, just wanted to rant about how dumb this episode is. Oh and the dumbest thing is that in the end the blond Mudd woman STAYS on the planet with that horrible, horrible man. Yuck. Didn't even feel like he learned a lesson about treating women better or anything! I can't believe Kirk let that happen.

Its in their culture. Tellingly they don't need to stamp out culture on their planet because even culture and the arts are dedicated to loyalty, the state, and the rule of law. 

Look at the literature Garak gives Bashir to read. The repetitive epic, seven generations of a family living and dying in service to the state. Or the Cardassian Enigma Tales (their equivalent to our mystery novels), all the suspects are guilty, the fun is determining what they're guilty of. 

Or look at the Cardassian system of jurisprudence. Televised. Always with a guilty verdict because the state is unerring in its accusations, and a typical Cardassian trial is supposed to end with a heartfelt confession and expression of remorse from the accused.

We'd be horrified by a legal system that functioned like this, but Cardassians find this system reassuring. The state always gets its man, the accused is always guilty. These people are begging for Big Brother.",startrek,1573816847,Smooth_Complaint,136,1,True,2019-11-15

These days I will watch it, but only by cherry-picking certain episodes and skipping past others. Lately I've started avoiding certain S1 and S2 eps as well. My ""blacklist"" currently includes:

\-The Alternative Factor (utterly incoherent)

\-Miri (the kids get on my nerves)

\-And the Children Shall Lead (the kids get on my nerves, version 2)

\-The Apple (the natives get on my nerves)

\-The Way to Eden (about as subtle, and as fondly remembered, as a punch in the face)

\-The Omega Glory (or at least the latter part of it)

\-The Empath (about 10 minutes of story couched in an hour of bad mime)

Any episode whose primary purpose is to be funny (Yes, that includes some of the better and more popular ones)

wife finished ds first time compared series,"My wife and I are excited for Picard to come out at the beginning of next year.  

Her family watched it off and on growing up, but it was never a main fixture in their house.  Plus, she always kinda viewed it as a boys show.  Since we got married, I re-introduced her to ST:TNG and she enjoyed it quite a bit (we watch it as we fall asleep).  With Picard on the way, we are both excited to enjoy the show to its fullest.

However, she had never seen DS9 or Voyager.  We committed to getting both shows watched before Picard started in order to get better context.

We finished DS9 last night, and I asked the obvious question as to what she thought of the series as a whole.

&gt;""Watching the show is like having boobs.... Painful and awkward at first, but then you eventually find you can have a lot of fun with it.""

I just kinda sat frozen - completely caught off guard.  Never heard Star Trek compared to Boobs before.  Plenty of accusations of those who saw the show never saw real boobs - but never such a direct comparison.  But thinking about it, its a pretty apt comparison.

She was left ultimately frustrated by the lack of conclusion for Sisko and his unborn child, any book recommendations she can read to get closure?

finally vindicated best list,"My favorite TNG episodes are pretty standard, The Inner Light, The Measure of a Man, The Best of Both Worlds, Chain of Command I/II but what I have said for years is that Darmok is the best TNG episode ever. It can be watched in complete isolation, without any prior knowledge of what Star Trek even is, and it will leave a lasting impression of what the show is and what it means to its fans. Even for the most wizened fans who love watching Sins of the Father then Reunion then Redemption despite knowing every line because the Worf arc is just so outstanding.

A lot of lists disrespect Darmok as an episode, probably because there's not a huge amount of fan support for it like there is for an episode like Yesterday's Enterprise. Don't get me wrong, I'm fine with Yesterday's Enterprise but if it's on a top 5 list of just TNG episodes and Darmok isn't there then that list is bogus.

[This list,](https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-top-100-star-trek-episodes-of-all-time-1641565699) published by Gizmodo in 2014, has a very reasonable top 10 of all series.

proposal gary seven series cbs,"Who else thinks that there should be a Gary Seven series on CBS All Access? It would involve his adventures trying to protect Earth and the timeline from various alien threats. There could be some crossing over with Discovery and Picard due to time travel, with Gary working alongside Burnham, Picard, maybe even Anson Mount's Pike or Ash Tyler.

Gary Seven - Barry Pepper (if you look at recent pictures of him, he somewhat bears a similarity to Robert Lansing)

Roberta Lincoln - Rose McIver

I'm simply curious about who y'all think has the best acting chops in TNG? and can you provide any particular examples?

It is probably safe to say that Patrick Stewart has the widest range here, but as the focal point of the show he is obviously going to get more screentime than others. His stellar (pun fully intended) performances in S3 E26/S4 E1 ""The Best of Both Worlds"" stand out for me.

To highlight someone with less screentime, I've always been incredibly impressed by Dwight Schulz's TNG fav Lt. Reginald Barclay. He manages to portray a character that makes my heart melt every time without fail, and much more convincing acting in general, even compared to the show's regulars.

Honorable mention to Brent Spiner's Lt. Commander Data, as he is able to pull out the performance of a lifetime portraying a character without emotion and a severe lack of facial expression and still make Data one of the most beloved relatable characters in the whole franchise.

ds season episodes past tense written different time still feasable concern today think totally lunch,"Past Tense is a two part episode, written in 1995, and directed in part by the man Jonathen Frakes. In the episode Commander Sisko, Dr. Bashir and Jatzia (jotsia, jat see ya, whatever who cares the pretty  one with spots)are wonderously transported to the year 2024, to a regular looking american city, and the men are promptly found and arrested by what appears to be police officers dressed up for the ghostbuster academy. The two are found without I.D, and thrrefore they are brought to a detention center (processing center), Where their hand print scanners and facial recognition software fails to turn up an american identity for them. They are informed they need to apply for a visa and find work, and are promptly released into a walled 'sanctuary district' where it is clear they are never going to score an interview.

Benjie and Jules decide to poke around and comment on how sad it is the mentally ill and socially deviant are treatdd this way, and how 'humans and cardassians really cant be so different after all..."" (Sure just keep those spoonheads out of my country, amiright? Except Garak. Lower the pitchforks, we all love Garak.) Meanwhile Dax is running around being all high class sexy, and convincing basically a silicon valley communications business man that he should help her find her friends.

Basically long story short they fuck up the timelines and basically have to do some time line maintaining shit, hold some people hostage, get some people killed, cameo a guy from I think frasier or seinfeld or cheers or something, cops bust in, shots fired, sisko dead but not, colm meany and kira eventually stop dicking around with hippys and the crew returns home to find shits all good now on to the next adventure.

I think we can all agree, our cops dont look like ghostbusters. Also, although detroit may appear a dystopean wasteland we havent walled it up yet and thrown prisoners in. However, personally I noticed the plot and the fears seem a little less far fetched to me nowadays. Granted, the episode was aired in 1995, and so I was five, im sure it must have used exaggeration of their events as a tool to talk about their problems. I guess what I noticed was that i was bothered how they seemed to have gotten a few things right. 

As it is in 2019, facial recognition is here, and governments are using it. People without identification are essentially being told to go through the process of immigration the right way, then being placed in cinditions that are nearly inescapable. (I think of refugees in australian prisons, and mexican people held up in detention centers, and uygher camps where they government is essentially trying to put people away and forget.) And also locking up the mentally ill and trying to forgrt about them aswell.

If you were someone old enough to watch the episodes when they came out and understand their context, did you believe the world would turn out the way they predicted or not? If your like me, and too young to remember it in context, do you see it paralleling our current world, or the world 5 years from now? Do you believe the world could ever look like that for us?

Personally I think it is an interesting episode. I cant imagine America or my country (Canada), ever really looking like that, but at the same time I know that the ""hide the undesirables"" does go on in our world, and big brother is absolutely a reality. Do you see any other mirrors to our world? Or funny shit they were way wrong about. (I mean those clothes, and that huge computer desk thing)

What's strange, though, is that I suddenly find these movies much easier to enjoy. I think it's because the larger Trek universe is shifting back to a more ""prime timeline"" focus.

quark speeches really make think spoilers,"Over the course of DS9 you see Quark, who starts off as what you would expect from your basic Ferengi - turn into one of the most well played and written supporting characters in the show he teaches you a thing or two over the shows 7 seasons.

&amp;#x200B;

**Quarks Speech about the Ferengi:**

\[Link: [**https://youtu.be/zNu1cdISsvY?t=57**](https://youtu.be/zNu1cdISsvY?t=57) \] I could only find a high quality video of that speech from a video about inspirational speeches of Star Trek (Its an amazing video a definite recommend to watch.)

This speech gives us the perspective of a Ferengi and how others view their race when in all honesty we were either the same or as he argues worse. The Ferengi race is viewed very badly by many Star Trek fans especially when they were first introduced in TNG and they are viewed badly by most people in the Trek universe; but I believe Quark is correct, humans despise Ferengi because Quark is right, Humans did do much worse in the past and the Ferengi are a reminder of what we were (Or even are today in the real world.)

&amp;#x200B;

**Quark Speech about Greed - A big eye opener for me:**

\[Link:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zEBGpr4YYA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zEBGpr4YYA)  \] I believe this speech cuts out a bit early, but its what I found.

Greed is viewed as a bad trait both in Star Trek and society today, but Quark is right - Greed is necessary in an imperfect society. In a society that can't band together in perfect harmony and strive to be better than itself; greed is the true motivator for people to do better and be better in order to be successful thus driving innovation and goals for people and society.

&amp;#x200B;

**Quarks Speech about the Federation:**

\[Link:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hdiuRMK3UQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hdiuRMK3UQ) \] Low quality, but again the one I found.

I enjoyed this speech because it gave us a unique perspective about how others view the Federation and makes you think.

series episodes would best introduce someone star trek currently zero interest anything sci fi firmly set reality,"I am a trekkie through and through, grew up watching TNG and Voyager and throughout my adult life I have had one series or another on constant play in my down time. However, my other half has no interest in it whatsoever. He likes historical things, war programmes, crime, thrillers etc. He really doesn't enjoy anything that's not strictly 'real', and he's been around when I've been watching the end of an episode every now and then and he just completely zones out, makes no effort to get into it at all. We've been together almost 15 years and he has never shown any interest in star trek whatsoever, so I either watch when he's not around or when he's sleeping. It works well enough, I get my fix several times a week so I'm happy. HOWEVER. A few days ago, he asked me something I thought I'd never hear. He asked, if he was going to watch it which one should he start with?

Imagine my surprise!

I was genuinely so shocked I didn't even know what to say, I started rattling through, well, start at the beginning but TOS is really dated now but it's still good but you'd have to accept it looks old and cheesey at times, or DS9 because it's more war based so maybe more down your street but it references so many other things that have happened previous you won't appreciate it as much, or Discovery as it's the latest one so more modern and less likely to put you off by looking dated but again references older series'....
He followed quickly with just because he's asking doesn't mean it's going to happen. But just asking the question feels like such a massive step all the same, I feel like I need to be prepared! 

But you see my dilemma.

I feel like this is a really risky opportunity. I have one shot to get him hooked (or at least not put him off forever).

I wondered if maybe the new films might be a good place to start, but they're less 'trek' than the series' so not necessarily an ideal introduction (and they're also incidentally the only trek things I've not really watched properly). 

My real issue is that I hate doing things out of order, so even when I watch through the series I normally just bash through each series in full, in order, from TOS through to Enterprise then rinse and repeat. My biggest barrier is starting him midway through something! But equally, I don't think he'll be into the old school TOS (or even early TNG) stuff. 

HELP! 

Have any of you been through this? What worked, and what didn't? 
Any suggestions at all would be appreciated!

amok time older depictions vulcans,"I'm watching through TOS right now, in the final leg of my quest to watch all major installments of Trek, and I've just gotten to Amok Time, and I gotta say, I think it's a little sad that the representation of Vulcans seems to have become homogenized as Spock became the breakout character for Trek. I say this primarily because we see Vulcans with hair that isn't that godawful bowl cut thing that they're always rocking in TNG onwards, Tuvok excepted (to an extent). Both T'Pau and T'Pring are rocking these long braided hairdos, but years later in Enterprise, we see T'pol following in Spock's visual style with her short hair, which, granted, gets looser as the show progresses. 

I am, of course, speaking mostly in a meta sense, I'm not really interested in the in-canon explanation for it. I suppose the pointed ears were enough to tell the audience that Vulcans were Vulcans in TOS, and they had to be made more visually iconic when other races got added, but it gave a pretty flat visual impression for later Vulcans.",startrek,1570154278,Cook_0612,9,20,True,2019-10-03

let brainstorm potential pike series names,"We know the Pike series is coming, so I think it would be fun to brainstorm and try to guess some potential Pike series titles.

Personally I DO NOT believe that it should focus on Pike (just like how ST: Picard focuses on Picard). They shouldn't do that. They have years of character development for Picard to focus on. Whereas Pike, almost nothing. 

* Star Trek: (Christopher) Pike (Chronicles)
 * Not really good as it implies a focus on Pike, which probably isn't interesting, it should focus more on the adventures of his ship and crew.

* Star Trek: 1701
 * I like this, but it sounds cryptic, like to some random person ""what the hell does 1701 mean?"". I think this title would be good for an anthology series. It can be like Doctor Who which was cancelled back in 1989-ish and brought back in 2005. Same series, same canon, just different stories for different time periods. For now, they can focus on Pike's command, at some point they can do a prequel to Robert April, they can go to Harriman, Garrett, (maybe even Va'kel Shon if they want to make him canon?). But the main focus would be the adventures of the Enterprise and her crew throughout history. If they want to cancel the series, cool, just bring it back with a new production team, just like Doctor Who in 2005.

* Star Trek: The Lost Era/Years
 * Not fond of this, ""Lost Era"" or ""Lost Years"" is ambiguous. There are many eras in Star Trek which we know nothing about, and by the time the series is over, it is no longer a lost era, and what happens if you want to visit another Lost Era?

* Star Trek: (The) Menagerie
 * Obviously a callback to The Menagerie, but this would imply that Pike's adventures are just an illusion. A stupid title TBH.",startrek,1570162913,intrepid48,20,2,True,2019-10-04

coup de grace measure man picard demonstrated maddox less self awareness data,"Maddox enters into pseudo-legal proceedings against Data. While he technically has a strong legal case, socially his position is problematical from the get-go. 

First, he seems completely unaware that anybody would feel camaraderie with Data. His attitude is blatantly condescending.

Second, he comes across as Ill-prepared to justify himself or his arguments when Picard questions him about the distinction he draws with Data.

Third, he’s completely ignorant of the legal ramifications. Picard’s argument rests upon the external perceptions of the event. “Won’t we be judged by how we treat that race?” Maddox hasn’t seemed to consider the worst case scenario that Data is sentient and Maddox kills him.

alien races could next receive redesign,"... and what could they look like?

This was inspired by the frequent talk about the cosmetic changes that happened to the Klingon race over the course of various Star Trek seasons. While there are several attempted in-universe explanations as to why they look so different in their various incarnations, the most likely reason is simply that, in the writer's intentions, Klingons always looked like in their most recent incarnation (DIS at the time of this writing) and that makeup technology and budget needed time to catch up. And I can totally see them saying the same about many other aliens.

I thought it would make for a fun experiment to consider what other races could receive the same treatment in the future, wether for good or bad, and what they could end up looking. *

I'll start by proposing the Andorians. Their look is iconic, but also fairly silly. I could totally see their future portrayal becoming less human like, for example by doing away with their hairs in favour of more complex makeup and prosthetics for the antennae, maybe hiding their ears so that it appears that the antennae serve an auditory function as well.

Another safe bet is the Gorn. They already sort of got it in Enterprise, but I'm expecting future incarnations to be even less humanoid and more like something that came out of InGen labs.

* please note that this thread is not for discussing if changing the appearance of an iconic alien species is good or not, just which one will be next to be redesigned to better suit a modern audience, at least in theory.",startrek,1570210469,Top_Score_0,22,6,True,2019-10-04
appreciated episode tng e survivors,"I just re-watched this episode today. After getting all teary-eyed at the end, I decided to google it to read some other reviews, only to discover that apparently lots of people think this is a ""skippable"" episode? It's apparently too boring and as usual no one likes Troi. 

Personally, while certainly it's no ""The Best of Both Worlds,"" I feel this is a solid episode in the grandest tradition of Star Trek. 

The episode revolves are around a very strange central mystery. The Enterprise responds to a distress signal from a human colony, and arrives to find the colony totally destroyed, save one pristine home with an elderly coupling living in it. A side story begins to unfold in which Troi is being slowly driven mad by creepy music box music constantly playing in her head. 

There is very little action or excitement, save a few attacks from a mystery alien ship. The episode moves slowly. There are many quiet conversations. Picard is at his most Picard-y: empathetic yet skeptical, annoyed yet clearly intrigued by mystery. 

Like many great Star Trek episodes the ending largely resolves around a moral question: is pacifism justifiable even in the face of a hostile enemy? When the mystery is finally resolved you feel the full weight of this question on the alien's moral compass. You feel the grief and terrible guilt the alien feels over what has happened. The actor gives an excellent delivery. Ultimately no answer is given; the Enterprise moves on with the understanding that some things in the universe are above their pay grade. 

Is it a perfect episode? No. Is everything about it wrapped up in a neat little bow? No. But it is the type of episode that makes you feel, and gives you the space to think. That is everything I love (and everything I miss) about Star Trek.",startrek,1570210519,marmosetohmarmoset,28,42,True,2019-10-04

people stop wanting explanations,"Seriously. Prior to Discovery, everything was at least attempted to be explained. TMP Enterprise was a refit of the original. Enterprise A looked different internally because it was a new ship. The D had to be crashed to replace it with the E. JJ Abrams trek takes place in an alternate universe. As dumb as the Klingon head thing is, they at least tried to explain it.

It seems like explanations are hated now. What happened between the last series or movie and Discovery that adapted the whole ""ignore continuity, accept artistic license"" thing? What is so wrong with minor explanations being thrown here or there. We are never going to see the Enterprise during Kirk's era. They would have to re-do the entire Original Series?

q continuum road desert,"Image link: [https://imgur.com/jS1gsjY](https://imgur.com/jS1gsjY)  
Visited a Star Trek filming location this week: The Club Ed movie &amp; television set, near Lancaster, California.  
First noticed the place on the Windows 10 screen saver, where a photo of ""Bob's Hi-Way Service"" station appears in rotation. Researched it, and discovered that it's a movie &amp; TV set, called ""Club Ed,"" built in 1990 for a long-forgotten Dennis Hopper movie (""Eye of the Storm""). It was so well-built, it has been kept intact ever since as a set for film and TV production, and photo shoots.  
It's located along a lonely 2-lane back road, and when we drove up at dawn, we were greeted by a surreal sight: A shabby, run-down 1950s gas station, cafe, motel, and garage, sitting in the middle of the desert. But none of the businesses were real, and never had been. It was all Hollywood, sitting and weathering in the Mojave.  
I was delighted to discover the site was featured as a Star Trek setting in the 1996 ***Star Trek: Voyager*** episode ""Death Wish"" (ST:VOY s2e18). In that episode, The Q attempt to show Capt. Janeway a representation of the Q Continuum that her mind could comprehend, and this desert rest stop was what Q showed her.  
In the episode, the cafe building featured a sign reading, ""We Never Close"" and a Galaxy pinball machine, which are gone now. The building was painted a different color back then -- it's aqua now -- and the nonfunctional gas pumps have been changed out, but it's definitely the same place where Q said they had ""all been the scarecrow, big deal.""  
This is the second Star Trek location we've visited, after visiting nearby Vasquez Rocks last year. I feel like a pilgrim visiting holy Star Trek shrines.  
Club Ed is not set up for tourists, and there are big ""No Trespassing"" signs and chains across the entry drives. Park on the road, but don't enter the property. A caretaker is on site to chase off the looky-loos.  
Which he did. We're sorry.

Tom and B'Ellana felt forced to me, like it was written into the show out of nowhere. Harry Kim was the first starfleet officer to gain B'Ellana's relative trust and also the first to see her in an emotional/vulnerable state. I think this was a large unused opportunity to add more depth to the character of Harry Kim.

ferengi would make great warriors,"On a tactical level: They are small and nimble therefore more difficult to hit with phasers than big bulky Klingons. 

They duck/cower a lot. This is also a great way to avoid getting shot. 

On a strategic level, they cheat. As the old saying goes “All’s fair in love and war”

Consider the following quotes about the US military. 

“A serious problem in planning against American doctrine is that the Americans do not read their manuals, nor do they feel any obligation to follow their doctrine.”
– Soviet observation during the Cold War

""The reason the U.S. Navy does so well in wartime is that war is chaos, and the U.S. Navy practices chaos on a daily basis.""

There are many strategic advantages to being unpredictable. 


About motivation to fight: I’ve always wondered why there is war in a post scarcity society. Everyone has all that they want. What does it matter who is the ruler? Only a minority of races would be motivated to engage in war and they would be motivated not by scarcity but by ideology or religion. The Klingons go to war to go to heaven. They cannot go to heaven without war. Thus they are motivated to fight even if they have all they need in terms of material possessions. The Ferengi are motivated by profit and cannot go to heaven without it. Even if they have all that they need in terms of material possessions they need. The Ferengi have the motivation to go to war.",startrek,1570365907,sithlordbinksq,31,28,True,2019-10-06

**Short Trek #5 - ""Q &amp; A""**

* This is the first installment of Star Trek with a title containing the word ""Q"" without featuring Q himself. Two other episodes, ""The Quality of Life"" and ""The House of Quark,"" both contain capital Qs but not the popular antagonist.
* We don't know precisely when this episode takes place, but it is between 2250, when Robert April was last in command of the Enterprise, and 2254, the year of ""The Cage."" Spock's early career is muddy, with some TOS dialogue saying he entered the Academy around 2250 and some saying he graduated that year.
* The text on Number One's padd is a memo essentially dictating what she's saying, and concerns ""quantum-stochastic models"" of combat. Her and Spock touch on this subject during their conversation.
* Although updated visually, the general look of the Enterprise transporter room is faithfully recreated, with shapes and lights resembling how it looked in TOS.
* Spock recites his serial number: S-179-276SP. This comes from ""Court Martial.""
* When Spock says ""reporting for dutYYY"" his inflection is reminiscent of traditional naval speech...as well as how Spock talked in ""The Cage."" His tendency to smile in this short also matches his mannerisms in TOS' earliest episodes.
* Professor Onafuwa has not been mentioned in the franchise. A googling reveals no obvious candidates for real-world references.
* Number One calls down to engineering and gets Upjohn, who speaks with a clear Scottish accent. Of course. ""An Obol for Charon"" establishes the Enterprise at that time has a chief engineer ""in love with *his* ship;"" Upjohn sounds female, so this is probably a different person.
* It is of interest to note that Pike is already being described as one of the most decorated captains in Starfleet.
* Pike's love for horses comes from ""The Cage,"" although I'm pretty sure this was already referenced in DIS.
* Replicator systems mentioned include references to ""Gupta"" and ""Katzman,"" which do not appear to be in-universe references.
* Spock attempts to discuss the questionable ethics and logic of the Prime Directive. It would seem that even in the 23rd century, officers can see the flaws behind this malleable, hazy law.
* The two discuss the beauty of Delta Scuti-type stars. This is a variable star that astronomers rely on to gauge intragalactic distances; they cite 99 Pegasi as an example, and in real life this star is indeed a variable.
* The rescue mission at ""Ling Plateau"" is not a reference that I'm aware of.
* Number One sings the ""Major-General's Song"" from Pirates of Penzance. This was the song that Crusher goaded Geordi into attempting in ""Disaster"" (after which they were also both trapped together). It's notable that Zach Quinto, who plays Spock in the Kelvin films, performed this song on stage.

**Nitpicks**

* This short continues DIS' artistic choice of portraying turbolift shafts as cavernous abysses with no visible top or bottom. There is little possibility that a ship like the Enterprise could contain such a feature; it would mean that the vessel is essentially hollow. Additionally, the turbolift ride is fairly long *before* it breaks down, and Amin is rappelling down ""from Deck 9."" The transporter room would have to be at the very bottom and back of the ship to justify the length of such a trip. This second part is not necessarily an explicit error, and may in fact be a reference to all the *other* times in which the turbolift moves at the speed of plot.",startrek,1570369756,Antithesys,23,20,True,2019-10-06

It doesn't seem to be Betazed as well (at least in comparison to what we've seen in Ménage à Troi for example).

What's the alternative? Holodeck onboard USS Titan.
The producers surely know how to make misleading trailers – and in my opinion it's possible, that they haven't missed a great opportunity to do just that.

Jonathan Frakes said sometime ago, that they are not in military anymore? Not really, the exact quote (in response to a question about the relation between Riker and Troi) was:
&gt; ""I can’t obviously tell you, but Marina and I… Well, you’ll see where we are. We’re together, and it’s quite… it’s non-military. I’ll say that.""

I initially thought I would watch in chronological order (having that opportunity to join the game late) but ended up not watching tos, tos movies, or tos animated series. It just seems so long ago to be against my general aesthetic liking. Based on advice from a friend I had started with enterprise. Moved to voyager after not liking early tng. I finished ent and voy. I loved them so much. Went back to tng and have come around to loving it as well. I prefer janeway and archer to Picard but I’ve slowly learned to love Picard (not as much as riker though)

Wesley seems to be a universally hated character, even will Wheaton doesn’t like him much as I’ve read, but I love Wesley. I still haven’t reached him actually being in star fleet academy yet, although I know of his mistakes. I understand he is unusually intelligent but that certainly occurs irl as well. Also side note, knowing the future, Tom Paris in voyager would have had a much better back story as nick lacarno from tng world. Whoever the actor is I did love Paris but had they continued his life as lacarno it would have been soooo awesome. Not sure if the timeline adds up well enough but it does seem to.

picard trailers revealed much,"&amp;#x200B;

So from the trailers I've learned the following things: 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Picard has retired to his Vineyard following a horrible experience leading a top-secret, unauthorized rescue mission, possibly relating to the destruction of Romulus.
2. Picard appears to be somewhat famous to the general public doing media interviews years after his Starfleet career has ended. 
3. While chilling on his vineyard, Picard is approached by a mysterious young woman named Dajh who needs his help.
4. Picard asks Starfleet to provide this help. They refuse. He gathers a motley crew together and   
does it anyway on a rogue mission. 
5. The crew includes a pilot, a scientist, a couple of Romulans and a few other Federation outcasts. 
6. Dajh's request for help has something to do with the Borg and the Romulans, who are apparently holding former Borg captive on a prison ship.  It seems pretty obvious that at least part of this mission is to break these people free. Somehow this situation is an allegory for immigration and refugees in the modern world. Maybe the Borg collective has disbanded and millions of former drones are returning to their homelands?
7. Somehow Hugh the Borg is involved in all of this. Maybe accidentally or intentionally Hugh implemented the plan to destroy the Borg discussed in in the episode ""I, Borg"". 
8. Dajh has some sort of savior or messiah like status. She's special for some reason. She also appears to have super-human abilities. 
9. Soong type androids have been produced en masse. Dajh may or may not be a Soong/Borg hybrid. 
10. Data appears, but it seems only in Picard's dreams. 
11. Riker and Troi appear in the first season. Riker has retired to what looks like Alaska, or at least the closest to Alaska one can get while filming in California. 
12. Seven of Nine is in the show and she's working to better the lives of former borg like herself. She's probably deep in the same issues Dajh and Picard have been dealing with. Jeri Ryan appears to have invented some sort of anti-aging device and has chosen to not share it with the rest of us. She's leaving billions on the table.
13. The saucer section of the Enterprise-D still exists. Maybe it's on a holodeck. But probably in a museum somewhere. 
14. Marin County is no longer a primarily a low-density residential area in the 24th century, but has been instead been potmarked by rather ugly skyscrapers. 
15. The Romulans are using old-school ships for some reason. 
16. The show will be action heavy, lots of ship battles and hand-to-hand combat.

federexit brits theory star trek picard spoilers,"As a Brit, there is really no escaping this at the moment. So one of the first things that came to mind when I saw the flag was Brexit, or rather Federexit if you will. 

I thought about a major power leaving the federation and becoming a bit more isolationist. Maybe even Earth. Limiting the free movement of people (not of Brexit and Trump here) which is why you don’t seem to see a litany of aliens wandering around any of the Starfleet HQ, or Earth shots... seems very human. 

The isolationism could explain why Riker has retired, and why Admiral NotNecheyev tells him its not his thing anymore?

The collapse of the federation might also explain a little about how the Romulans have been allowed to get away with their implied Borg Testing. 

I also wondered if this could tie into the Romulus Rescue mission, and may be Picard used his contacts and influence to run the mission without approval, as it was against Earths stance, OR they seceded from the Federation after that mission to avoid the influx of immigrants from Romulus?

Patrick Stewart has very strong views on Brexit, so it might be why he’s so interested in the story.

federation falling,"Seems we're about to witness a complete derailment of all trek we have seen before. And something that fits into every other Sci fi better than this one.

This is a story better placed in things like Halo which already had an insurrection, star wars which has an empire fall every trilogy, battlestar galactica which had humanity destroyed by its own creation and pretty much any other (bar stargate tbh) Sci fi series.

I'm not a fan of this dark bleak outlook. That is not what I am in star trek for.

We had:
Enterprise: The formation of the federation and witnessing humanity's push to succeed against all odds
TOS: Space cowboys with the federation in its formative years
TNG: Almost peak federation
VOY: A lone captain using the federations ideals to keep her crew together and alive while they try to get home
DS9: Trouble in paradise. A federation struggling to maintain its peaceful stance in a time of all out war. Trying to maintain its morality in arguably a worse encounter than the borg. (this is the kick off point where I would say we get our modern iterations of trek)

Now we have:
DSC: Still the cowboy years, but this time with some pretty hurrendous warcrimes. It shows that space is the size of the UK as it happens that burnham is the sister of spock and that the enterprise wasn't too far away. Now they're jumping into the future, 200 years after we have latest seen in ENT and the federation has gone fucked. Just collapsed into 6 planets. (And of course discovery is going to be what saves it...)

Picard: ehm, I'm not sure yet. Seems to be an advancement of the evil admirals he has always bee fighting. The ma's sproduction of soong class androids isn't good though. But with other threads discussing the exit of the colonies starting now I sure as fuck hope not.

I'm not making this thread to shit on shows I haven't seen yet. But currently in my real life I am living through brexit, mutters of more troubles and another indipendence referendum. I am just a young man trying to make it through his studies.

I use star trek as a means of escape, to have a window into a potential future once all this bullshit is over.

I sure as hell don't need it to slap me in the face with the most obvious referances to current events to ever be shat out of the writers room. Trek has always referanced real life, but never so bloody on the nose.

I'm sorry, I look like one of those crazy people... The ones that hate the shows just for existing but that's not the case. I'm just tired of people changing shit and calling it modernization.

k upscaling tests voyager,"Following hot on the trail of /u/Captrobau and his excellent upscaling tests, I thought I'd give Voyager another shot using the latest version of GigaPixel AI.

The results, which are [here](https://youtu.be/L1Zz2t-B0vk) are interesting to say the least.

The most obvious issue I can see is a mistake on my part. The new version of the app has an option for 'face refinement' which I enabled and had thought would help help upscaled faces look more natural (they can often look strange around the eyes), but it seems that what it actually does is to dynamically recreate new faces (presumably from a set of pre-made face captures) in places where the details of a face are way too blurred.

It should be pretty obvious to spot, keep an eye on the background actors. It made me laugh, but yeah, that approach is a no-go.

The only other concern I have with the approach is the grain that appears on the upscaled version. It looks quite false.
It just so happens that Topaz Labs have an amazing Denoiser which works absolute wonders and can mitigate this effect, but it can't batch process images, so that's not an option for now. [Here's](https://imgur.com/a/0B3tY27) an example though of a frame ran through Gigapixel, and then Denoiser, and I must admit, I think it came out great.

Overall, I'm super impressed with this tech. I appreciate that CBS might not want to spend millions on remastering DS9/Voyager properly, but as long as there's a standard definition source that doesn't suffer from the same compression artifacts and frame interpolation issues as the DVD source, this would be a great alternative if used correctly.

One final example [here](https://imgur.com/9v10ZNu) of a DVD frame ran through both the upscaler and denoiser.",startrek,1570465448,scragnog,15,20,True,2019-10-07

star trek picard discovery alone opinion,"Am I alone in wishing that discovery among other things didn’t abandon established canon of how the 23rd century looked in star trek.

We have seen time and time again what the federation looked liked in that century yet discovery and now from the look of it the picard series goes for the cliche scfi look. Holographic controls, advance looking computers that can only exist thanks to a CGI budget.

The original series was buttons and dials not hologram’s. Controls that even enterprise kept to and made the look of the show flow into the original series so everything shown would become what was in the original series. 

The next generation, deep space nine and voyager all had the LCARS which was a multi used touch control and screen built into one system. 

I don’t see how technology can go from practical technology that works incredibly well to holographic controls that from the look of it are more of a gimmick than practical for everyday use. 

It would appear that writers for current star trek have only seen the JJ version or can’t think of how technology would naturally process in a society with established technology and lore and instead go for what looks cool.

maps space canon non canon,"I've been looking around today a good deal for maps of space that entail proper canon positions of, well, everything. From the territories of major powers, to planet and starbase locations and names. The problem is, I've seen just about a half a dozen different maps, and they all show different information. That's a big issue for me, since I've been working on a pilot script for a new Star Trek series. Because of how the plot goes, I want to be sure I know the canononical locations of everything, rather than just vague ideas or assumptions.

On one map for example, I've seen the Tholian Assembly being placed as a small territory below the Klingon Empire and bordering the Gorn, and the Breen having a small territory near the Ferengi Alliance. Then there's other maps instead showing the Tholians past Cardassian space with a vast territory, and the Breen more closely bordering the Cardassian Union, which makes more sense based on what Deep Space Nine had mentioned before. (In DS9 there are several mentions of the Tholians, including Cassidy Yates mentioning that she had rendezvous to make with Tholian ships. If they were really near the Klingon Empire, that's one heck of a distance to travel.)

My guess is that the latter maps are likely the more accurate ones for lining up better with conclusive evidence based on the series canon.

Star Trek is different. People who grew up on Trek are inspired to become scientists, astronauts, inventors and engineers. It forms our morality and sense of right and wrong. It brings us hope for the future. It shows everyone has the capacity to contribute and lead and it shows that when we cooperate on common mutual goals nothing is beyond our reach.

started star trek tos finished enterprise every star trek episodes movies released moment,"I can say now, I loved TOS, Spock was the character I cared about the most. I loved the way he had to speak about science, logic, the fact that facts aren't a matter of opinions.

But it was TNG that really made me love Star Trek, I wish everyone could see at least one episode of that series. It was like TOS but much more mature, each episode could bring so deep reflexions about the meaning of life, what it means to be human, why are we here out there, exploring ? I loved Data, I think because he is the absolute opposite of Spock, wishing to be more human, to actually feel emotions. Oh boy what a character.

DS9 was refreshing, I liked the fact to watch a more ""modern"" series with a real story from the beginning to the end. Plus every character was awesome in their own way (Sisko especially, and Quark my favourite of all). Also it was very nice to finally see what a civilian life could be like in the Star Trek universe.

But then I watched Voyager. And oh my god this was the best of the best of all I have seen in the Star Trek franchise. It was difficult at first, I only liked one character, the Doctor. Everyone else seemed... meh... But as they were more and more developed, you just can't help it, you have to love each of them. AND Seven of Nine comes in at season four and she becomes truly the best character, all series combined. I think I loved her for the same reason I loved Spock and Data, the questioning she brings about humanity, she and the Doctor were the best duo of all time for that reason. I'll always remember their courses about how to socialize. My only regret with Voyager was the final. &gt;!I would have liked to see one last episode about the rehabilitation of each member of the crew once back on earth.!&lt;

Last month I finally watched Enterprise. It was fine, not the crap everyone told me I would be. It was great to see the early years of Starfleet, the small references they made to link it up to TOS. It didn't like T'Pol at first, but her duo with Tucker worked so well I can't imagine one without the other now.

cbs perfect opportunity tell traditional trek stories relatively new setting time titan show,"While Picard would make most things set after Nemesis a prequel, there’s a good 20 year gap in which one could set a show about the adventures of the *USS Titan*. 

For those who are unaware or perhaps need some more detail, the *Titan* is Riker’s first (and likely only) command in the canon. Taking command shortly after Nemesis, *Titan* is a Luna-class long-range exploratory vessel [looks absolutely baller](https://images.app.goo.gl/firDKTQzgGYKem6U8). Now that we know Riker and Troi remain alive and well (and with a child!) into Picard, we know they must’ve been around to do something in the 20 year gap. 

A few things conspire to make a *Titan* show perfect to bring in Trek fans that have yet to buy into the newer entries in the franchise, while also bringing in new fans:

-	*Titan* is one of the most diverse crews in Starfleet history, with only 15% of the complement being human. Some of those crew are truly alien, with the chief medical officer being a literal dinosaur person. The advent of relatively cheap, extremely effective CGI, combined with either puppetry or makeup (Saru and the new Klingons look fantastic), means Trek can show something genuinely unique to the setting, and tell stories with a variety of characters. 
-	The command crew of the *Titan* is a greatest-hits of the TNG era, interspersed with new faces: Riker as CO, a new human XO, Vale, Tuvok as chief of security, nurse Ogawa returning to the medical staff, Troi as chief counselor and diplomatic officer, etc. Also, the dinosaur person. Plus, a Cardassian bridge crew member. There’s just enough new blood to keep things dynamic, and a chance to revisit old favorites. 
-	*Titan’s* mission is old fashioned Trek: go boldly where no one has gone before. The books have the ship going outside the galaxy (by accident), to uncharted areas of the Beta quadrant, and discovering things the shows never even got near. Combine this exploration with serialized character arcs and you’ve got a winning combination of the best of Discovery and the olden ways. 

Not being privy to CBS corporate’s thoughts, I’d wager that they’ve considered this, and, perhaps it hasn’t gone through for a number of reasons. Having to pay royalties to authors to use characters and designs from the books and the difficulty of getting the old cast back (Frakes seems to be hesitant to return to full-time acting) would probably be big obstacles. 

However, if those could be overcome, and we could get a few seasons of *Titan* running around and engaging in some *Enterprise*-style shenanigans, I think that’s something the entirety of the fan base could fall in love with.

thought short treks would best vehicle bring back old characters,"Thinking about Q&amp;A and how it's telling a story with Number One and Spock and Pike has a small role in it and the upcoming one, I was thinking that it would be a pretty smart idea to use ""Short Treks"" every once in a while to do a quick one-off about a character we know and love. I'm really excited for all the old characters in ""Picard"" coming back, but there's a limit to what you can do because they have to fit organically in the story to some extent, otherwise it just feels like fan service and a really small universe, etc.

Imagine a quick story about O'Brien teaching at the Academy and dealing with a student he has to inspire. Or the Doctor living on Earth and meeting other holograms, or a Ferengi story. Or Beverly, LaForge, Riker, and Troi playing a poker game together and just hanging out. Or something about Wesley even. The possibilities are huge because they don't have to tie into larger stories, and the ask for the actors isn't all that massive. It's like a day or two of filming. And the ""Short Trek"" format is a great one-off unserialized story format - what you make doesn't have to tie into larger plots if you don't want it to, and you won't saturate the audience with a 10 minute story about someone you like. The Harry Mudd story is a really good example, it was just enough for us to like seeing him, and not so much that we got sick of him.

Not for all the Short Treks, just maybe one a year or something.

Just a thought. Everyone is talking about bringing back favorite characters, but no one seems to realize the potential of ""Short Treks"" to be that vehicle. It would be awkward to shoehorn them all into Picard.",startrek,1570566943,MTeson,43,66,True,2019-10-08

Now that the CBS Viacom merger has happened, does that mean the Picard show can show literally any ship/uniform? So we could see Picard on the bridge of the Enterprise E again. There are lots of possibilities.",startrek,1570630753,Coffee4thewin,25,0,True,2019-10-09

spoil spoil picard series,"Hey r/startrek!

Long time lurker, first time poster. I have a bit of a difficult decision to make regarding watching the upcoming Picard series.

I have been doing a very casual on-off marathon of all of the series (and movies) for around 10 years now. I started with the pilot of TOS, and I've been following the order in which the episodes actually aired. I have been doing it this way because I wanted the same viewing experience as if I was watching it when it came out (like I would know whatever the current viewer knew). Where I am at the time of this post is DS9 season 2 episode 17. Since this aired in conjunction with TNG season 7, I have 9 episodes left of TNG, and I haven't yet started Voyager.

With the upcoming Picard series, I have seen posts like this for relevant episodes to watch prior to release date: [https://old.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/dejm5v/what\_do\_i\_watch\_before\_picard/f2vxmm6/](https://old.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/dejm5v/what_do_i_watch_before_picard/f2vxmm6/)

The difficult decision I'm being faced with is this: do I watch those episodes in preparation the Picard series which would more or less spoil the 10 year long marathon I've been doing? Or do I attempt to wait until I finally catch up by at least finishing Voyager (which could potentially take quite a while at my current pace)? Or maybe there's third option I'm not thinking of? For those of you who have seen all of the series and movies, would these spoilers be something worth waiting for? Or are they not as big of a deal?

Maybe these will all come down to personal preference, but I really don't know any other Trekkies other than me IRL. So I just thought I'd put it out there and see what you guys think. Cheers",startrek,1570634613,Foppin,11,0,True,2019-10-09

ds finished ds last night thoughts far,"So I grew up on TNG as a kid and it's always been my favorite Trek (admittedly not that I've watch a whole lot of any of the other Treks) I finally got around to finishing TNG all the way through a month or two ago, so I decided to dive right in to DS9 (I actually believe I started it right after Aron Eisenburg died). I'd never gotten around to watching DS9 or Voyager (which will be next!) partly because I heard things like that DS9 is ""too spiritual"" and the idea of it being based on a static space station seemed boring (didn't know about the wormhole until I started watching).

I can't believe I'm saying this, but I think that DS9 MIGHT be better than TNG. At the very least in the writing department. I've just been blown away with all the amazing character development in just the first 3 seasons alone. I'm not sure there is a main character that I don't like (then again I can't think of anyone other than Wesley that I didn't like on TNG). Even Rom has started having some nice character development. I also love the callbacks to stuff that happened in TNG like Tom Ryker and Troi's mom. With TNG I felt like there were a lot of episodes (especially early on) that were so hard to watch. But I feel like there haven't been many of those in DS9, except for maybe some of the Bajoran politics, which I honestly barely care about at all.

new fan take star trek motion picture,"I have never seen a single episode of Star trek as it was not really popular in my part of the world but I did kept hearing about it. I wanted to check it out. I am not a TV series guy, I like my 2-3 hours long films and so I checked out the first Star Trek flick from 1979 and I really liked it. I had a good time. It was a pleasant and fun viewing. Now, what I don't get is the reviews to this film. Why are they so bad? Yes, this film is not as good as Alien or Star Wars, two well recieved Sci Fi flicks from that time but I think it is way less appreciated than it should be. The major criticism I found by everyone was the pacing. I did mind the pacing in the first half but it felt like a good build up for me because I had never experienced this fictional world before. Having read the reviews before watching the film I was expecting a below average film and as I said earlier, I genuinely enjoyed it. Saw Wrath of Khan just a while ago and it was the same for me. A good pleasant fun optimistic film. Now, Wrath of Khan has really glowing reviews, at times I also felt it got over praised but maybe to enjoy Wrath of Khan fully you need to have seen the series and have spent more time with the characters going into it. Don't get me wrong. I loved Wrath of Khan as well, but having read it's reviews beforehand as well I was expecting something on the level of Alien. 
So, can anyone tell me why is a (in my opinion) good film life Star Trek The Motion Picture so poorly received by the audiences and what made Wrath of Khan so special in the franchise?

discovery era starfleet starships legacy future use canon point view,"Hello!

Discovery,  whether one likes it or not, introduced many new Starfleet designs to  the canon, especially during the climatic Battle of the Binary Stars.   These aren't the Discovery or even the Enterprise and the rest of her  Constitution-class starship cadre- these vessels are the workhorses of  the era.

Most of these vessels can be seen on this poster: [http://www.ex-astris-scientia.org/scans/dis/dis-federation-scale-chart.jpg](http://www.ex-astris-scientia.org/scans/dis/dis-federation-scale-chart.jpg)

Since  Discovery happens close to the Original Series and some Original Series  / Movie-era (which happen near the same time) have gone forward in the  future (i.e. the Miranda, Oberth and Excelsior), I was wondering what  you guys think are the future usage of these ships in Starfleet past the  Original Series / Discovery era.

If  you can see other uses for them, how would Starfleet use some of these  designs in the future, whether it be for exploration or conflict?  If  you don't see them having a future past the Original Series / Discovery  era, where do you see their legacy in regards to design unless you think  certain designs were dead-ends?  Were some DSC Starfleet designs better  than other equivalent designs, in your opinion?

Since  we don't know a lot of technical detail about these starships, a lot of  these answers can stem from beta canon (i.e. the Starship Collection  magazine) or just visual looks alone.  I just thought this would be an  interesting discussion because they provide so much more variety to  Starfleet during this sparse era, which was mostly restricted by budget  during the early days of Star Trek on television.

A ban on technology only makes sense when it is enforced on both sides.  Like with nuclear nonproliferation treaties.

Additionally, Picard is out of line and out of order in unilaterally acting to stop new Federation technology and aiding the enemy in disclosing such sensitive intelligence.  Picard is charged with implementing policy, and as the admirals, Starfleet Intelligence, and conceivably politicians are reevaluating current policy Picard has no right or position to veto it.  His duty would be to officially report these actions in a classified manner to Starfleet command in case this was higher ups acting independently and going against command.

**Short Trek #6 - ""The Trouble with Edward""**

* The short's title references the TOS episode ""The Trouble with Tribbles."" That episode has produced a sequel (""More Tribbles, More Troubles""), a sidequel (""Trials and Tribbleations""), and now a prequel; it is perhaps as prolific as its namesake creatures.
* Pike gives the stardate as 1421.9, which we can surmise is utterly meaningless based on how DIS has used stardates. Since he is in command of the Enterprise, it takes place between 2250 and 2265.
* The Cabot is evidently of the same class as the USS Shran seen in ""Battle of the Binary Stars."" The ship has been designated Magee-class offscreen. This ship is perhaps named after the explorer John Cabot, the first modern European to reach North America, or his son Sebastian.
* The planet Pragine 63 is new to lore; it looks to be a Class M world with significant urban sprawl centered around a landmass that looks suspiciously like the Indian subcontinent. Dialogue implies that the natives are called Calatians.
* The Cabot's crew appear to wear a mixture of uniforms, with most resembling the DIS-era Enterprise science uniforms but missing the prominent black collar. At least one officer in the staff meeting is simply wearing a light sweatshirt with a Starfleet emblem embroidered onto it. Lucero keeps her Enterprise command uniform and other goldshirts and redshirts are seen later.
* Edward Larkin doesn't seem to be Starfleet material; he evokes fond memories of Reginald Barclay, as well as Mortimer Harren from ""Good Shepherd.""
* As Larkin, this is H Jon Benjamin's first Star Trek role; however, given his illustrious career in both tv comedy and animation, I would be shocked if he didn't reappear in the two upcoming animated series.
* This is not the ""first contact"" between Starfleet and tribbles, as they were previously seen in Phlox's lab in ""The Breach"" (see Nitpicks below); contemporary appearances include the tribble on Lorca's desk and those featured in the first two Kelvin films.
* The binomial nomenclature of tribbles is stated to be *Tribleustes ventricosus,* which must be a reference to the real-life [West Indian sea egg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripneustes_ventricosus), *Tripneustes ventricosus,* a sea urchin which resembles tribbles. I totally knew that.
* The tribbles' homeworld is stated to be Iota Geminorium IV, which was first established in a background display in ""The Nagus."" This planet would later be destroyed by the Klingons as a glorious climax to the Great Tribble Hunt.
* One of the Cabot's officers appears to be a Trill. We saw a Trill on Qo'noS in ""Will You Take My Hand,"" and we know Dax had dealings with humans throughout most of its lifetimes (including knowledge of TOS starship operations), but this is the earliest depiction of a Trill *actually serving in Starfleet.* This is a further burial of the premise of ""The Host,"" the episode which introduced the Trill and explicitly showed that the Trill's symbiotic nature was unknown to Starfleet. I don't count it as an error since DS9 started this retcon 25 years ago. I believe this is the first example of a dark-skinned Trill, though I could easily be wrong.
* A number of visual gags are lifted from previous tribble episodes, with tribbles lining the corridors, resting on chairs, falling out of cabinets and generally gumming up the works.
* The subtitles claim that the admiral at the inquiry is named Quinn. A member of the Q Continuum went by this name. Another admiral, Gregory Quinn, served in Starfleet Command a century later, and was possessed by a different kind of small creature considerably less cute and slightly more insidious.

___

**Nitpicks**

* There are a number of technical continuity problems in the briefing room scene, involving the positions of the characters' hands, heads, chairs, etc. between cuts. This sort of thing happens all the time in tv and film but for some reason I noticed it a lot here.
* Larkin claims the trouble with tribbles is that they ""breed very slowly,"" and wants to augment them to speed up the process. In ""The Breach,"" a century earlier, Phlox describes tribbles as breeding ""quite prodigiously,"" and that reptilian predators are the only thing keeping their population in check. It *might* be the case that Larkin was just a crackpot and didn't feel that the tribbles' already-rapid natural breeding rate was sufficient to feed a starving planet.
* I probably won't get a lot of argument if I propose that the post-credits commercial be considered non-canon; despite its inclusion in the short's official presentation, it makes absolutely no sense in terms of continuity.",startrek,1570753315,Antithesys,27,28,True,2019-10-10
enterprise silent enemy review,"I've been watching some episodes of Enterprise lately.   It holds up surprisingly well.   The characters are likeable.  Not perfect just dedicated hard working people, doing their jobs the best they can in tough circumstances.   I think there are fewer ""graduated top of his class at the Academy"" Mary Sues and Marty Stus than in other series.  They feel like people you might know or work with.

Story:

Enterprise is attacked and boarded by mysterious aliens.   Archer realizes he's been risking the ship and the lives of his crew by leaving too soon before all the tactical systems were installed.  He orders a return to Jupiter Station for a weapons upgrade.  It feels like defeat.   Tucker and Reed convince him to let them put a team together to try to do the install themselves.   They work around the clock and just barely get the new phase cannons installed as the aliens return and demand a surrender.

Tension builds as they scramble to get everything working fast enough or maybe lose the ship.  First shot with the new cannons is ineffective.  Trip makes a mad dash to do an intentional overload and they try another shot.  It's like watching your home team score a touchdown when they knock the enemy shields down with the cannons and Archer shouts ""Torpedoes!""  Makes you want to stand up and cheer.

That's the kind of storytelling I like the most about Enterprise.   They're always way out of their depth going deep into space for the first time.   But they pull together and make it work somehow.   

Ends with everybody having beer and birthday cake in engineering to celebrate their victory.

A well written episode.",startrek,1570757002,genericdude999,5,4,True,2019-10-10
review star trek discovery season one anyone cares,"https://unitedfederationofcharles.blogspot.com/2019/10/star-trek-discovery-season-one-review.html

I decided to do a binge watch of Star Trek: Discovery with my wife and enjoyed watching the first two seasons. I actually started by reviewing every individual episode on my blog but removed those because I wasn't able to follow them up. My opinion on Discovery is mixed despite my fandom. There's episodes that I absolutely love, episodes I don't feel much for, and choices I don't agree with.

Generally, I definitely think this is a Star Trek series worth sticking around for but it comes with quite a few caveats. They aren't going to be the ones like, ""The Klingons look different"" or ""It doesn't look like the time period."" I have my own complaints regarding that. However, I will have some criticisms. I hope you'll stick around to reading them. If not, just know that it has my endorsement but it's a 7 out of 10 rather than a 9 out of 10 like I'd hoped. That's the short version. The long version? Well, that'll take a bit.

The premise is that it is a prequel to the original Star Trek series and takes place roughly ten years before the events of ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"" but after ""The Cage."" Michael Burnham (Sonequa Martin-Green) is the adopted daughter of Sarek and Amanda Grayson as well as foster sister to Spock. Having achieved Commander in Starfleet, she is the second-in-command of Captain Phillipa Georgiou (Michelle Yeoh) on the U.S.S Shenzou.

The Klingons, under sinister cult leader T'Kuvma (Chris Obi), are restless and start a war that Michael is blamed for after a series of disastrous decisions. After serving a brief prison sentence for mutiny, Michael finds herself recruited as a work-release hire by charismatic but ruthless captain Lorca (Jason Isaacs) on the top-secret Starfleet vessel Discovery. They are possibly the Federation's last hope against a warrior race that grows stronger the longer the war goes on.

I feel like this is a show that had some definite rewrites and struggles behind the sets because it feels like there were multiple visions of the show that contradict each other. As I understand it, that's exactly what happened. The Klingon War is a factor in the series but not nearly the focus of the series you'd find in, say, Deep Space Nine with the Dominion War or even Babylon Five. It's a background element that is resolved in the first season and almost feels like the most interesting elements of it (T'Kuvma and Voq) are written out early on.

Indeed, the best episode of Season One ""Magic to Make the Sanest Man Go Mad"" has almost nothing to do with the Klingon War and is a standalone episode involving Harry Mudd (Rainn Wilson). I'm not going to complain about the visual continuity but I am a bit confused about the storytelling continuity. Harry Mudd is a pimp and a con artist in the Original Series but it's hard to believe Captain Kirk would let him go if he knew he was involved in terrorist acts against the Federation during a time of war.

On the other hand, I have to say that I genuinely like the cast of characters. Ensign Tilly (Mary Wiseman) is one of my top ten favorite Star Trek characters period and maybe has cracked the top five. I very much enjoy Saru (Doug Jones) and the fact that he's an alien who gives us an insight into the idea of fear the same way Spock did with logic. Fear dominates Saru and it is something that he finds both beneficial as well as debilitating. Both Michelle Yeoh and Jason Isaacs elevate the material they deal with to the point you kind of wish they were headlining the show for the indefinite future.

I feel like the show missed an opportunity to interact with both T'Kuvma and the Terran Emperor since both are set up as the socially relevant radical ethnic nationalist leaders of their peoples. Cosmopolitanism is the heart of Star Trek as is the idea of embracing people of as many diverse backgrounds as possible. Having the heroes confront that head on and the appeal of such things would have made for an engaging set of episodes, IMHO. Why do they fear diversity and change so much and what is the best way to confront such fear?

I feel like the show also missed an opportunity to develop many of the characters that it established. The Discovery bridge crew is visually interesting and I very much would have liked to have learned about them all. On the other hand, the fact we've got a fairly large crew this time around means that we aren't really skipping out anyone. Security Chief Ash Tyler (Shazad Latif) and Chief Engineer Paul Stamets (Anthony Rapp) make a pretty good impression. In a better late than never situation, Paul and Chief Medical Officer Hugh Culber (Wilson Cruz) are the first gay couple in Star Trek. Well, the first gay main characters period. If I had a complaint about the characters, its the fact that it kills quite a few that are quite interesting.

If I had to summarize Discovery's storytelling problems, it's that it feels like it jumps around too much and has one foot in serialized television while keeping its other in episodic. I feel like this series could have benefited from a stronger commitment to one or the other. I think it's to the series credit that I actually do like its episodic content and serialized episodes both. I would have happily watched a less special-effects heavy 26-episode series of them investigating new planets while exploring their characters.

There's also a couple of more problems that I do feel addressing. I like the character of Michael Burnham but I feel like the show doesn't know who, precisely, Michael is. She's an extremely emotional person when she's not extremely stoic. She's an idealistic Federation officer when she's not throwing the rules to the side completely. She's incredibly pigheaded and bigoted against Klingons until she's not. Contradictions aren't necessarily a bad thing to do with a character but she feels a bit schizophrenic like Captain Janeway did at times. Her best moments are when she's acting off another, more coherent character like Phillipa, Saru, Sarek, Tilly, or Captain Lorca. Indeed, that's the irony that the star really works best when being a supporting character.

Finally, there's another element that I feel distracts from my enjoyment of the series and that's the fact the science is nonsense. I don't mean in the usual Star Trek way of warp drive, space amoebas, and salt vampires. No, I mean you might as well say the ship is powered by rainbows and imagination. Nothing about the spore drive makes sense to fourth grade science, not the least being that space is not full of fungus (that requires atmospheres to grow as well as water--it also doesn't give you the power to teleport). I'm generally very ""soft"" in my sliding scale of soft versus hard science fiction but this goes beyond my limits--and is done with the utmost seriousness.

Nevertheless, this is a series that has a lot going for it. The show is full of action, amazing special affects, and some surprisingly good character moments. James Frain's Sarek is a surprisingly solid piece of recasting. We actually get a few moments that add to the original series like why he felt such a sense of betrayal at Spock leaving the Vulcan Science Academy for Starfleet. His episode, ""Lethe"", is one that does a great job of showing both the ups as well as downsides of the Vulcan race. Its not surprising when a show works better on characterization that pew-pew or big special effects but this is definitely one that does.

If I had to make a judgement, I'd say that while ""Magic to Make the Sanest Man Go Mad"" and ""Lethe"" are my favorite character episodes, the series mostly picks up in its second half. The Mirror Universe episodes are actually my favorite of that series. I never liked what Deep Space Nine did with the world-building and this take on them feels less sexist as well as just as goofy fun. I also loved how the Klingon War is ended in the grand finale as it shows the writers fully understood what Star Trek is about. 

In conclusion, I recommend purchasing a month of CBS All Access and binge-watching buying the first season separately. It's not the best Star Trek but it isn't the worst by far. Disco just has a rocky footing and yet there's still plenty of good here. If nothing else, the solid actors on display here are able to compensate for a lot of the weaknesses in the storytelling. I'd rather have too much than too little.

I need to know if it will continue to be this great or if it will go back to being a good show after a few episodes?

  If Season 6 is all entwined and as good as it is now, I'll have to force myself to stop watching until Sunday.  If its not, I can continue watching today until it gets back to its regular self.

Jonathan Frakes was 35 when STNG started.

Patrick Stewart was 47.

Wil Wheaton is 47.

- Curiosity, a desire to know
- Remorse/regret
- Caring for another person, the ability to have friendships
- A desire for vengeance... sort of (the most toys)
- Apparent sadness (when Picard leaves his recital)

I think Data seems to experience emotions more than the show claims.  The writers seem to struggle with writing any conflict for Data that doesn't involve emotional responses (beyond being unable to laugh, or unable to fall in love, or be offended, or other major ones) and thus kind of gave up on actually following through with that over the course of the show.  Because it is hard to write for a character that is literally emotionless, they instead choose to write an emotional (though somewhat stoic by human standards) character and then periodically remind us that he doesn't actually feel things so that we know his responses aren't *really* emotional.",startrek,1567521993,risemix,9,15,True,2019-09-03

Star Trek: The Exhibit descended on the McLaughlin Planetarium.  
 

 The commercials for Star Trek: The Exhibit played during the TNG re-runs on CityTV, a local network that showed TNG re-runs daily at 7pm in those times. I absolutely had to go.

relationship dr mora odo built mirror abusive father emotionally vulnerable son particular show intermittently interesting also awful,"So at this point imo Mora's a creepshow on par with Kai Winn. I've just finished Begotten and, whoa man.

So just to illustrate how I'm feeling about this the premise of the episode is that !&gt;Quark finds a changeling and 'sells' it to Odo. Odo bonds with it and part of his ethos is that he's going to take it slow; he's going to respect its comfort zone and not torture it for the amusement of a bunch of space Nazis. In other words, he's going to be a good parent. Sisko, genius that he is, recommends Odo bring along his dad to advise. Odo has a similar problem with Mora to Kira with Kai Winn, at least for me - I'm screaming for him to tell Mora to fuckoff back to legoland with his farcical approach to Ethics but for some reason Odo maintains the ear he has for him with delicate care. Not only does he acquiesce and let him in the same room as the child, admittedly out of spite, once Starfleet gets wind of it and demands reports on 'progress,' whatever the fuck that means, Odo, who as we know gives so many fucks about what the Federation likes and wants and has zero sense of personal pride or inclination to self-sacrifice, becomes the thing he hates at Mora's slightest prodding. For god's sake, Mora VERBATIM GOES 'sPaRe ThE rOd, sPoIl tHe ChIlD,' like he's a nun from the 80s. Admittedly he is Bajoran, which explains some of his behavior if it doesn't excuse it.&lt;!

Later on not only does Odo reconcile with dad, he downs bubbly with him. Hurray for giving in to political extortion!

Does anyone have, like, a snippet from the background work that explains the absurdity of this? On the one hand I like this because it really does seem like a plausible portrayal of a toxic dad reentering his estranged son's life clearly against his wishes and exploiting the pressure from his job and stuff to make them partners in crimes against solids. On the other the way the episode is framed it's borderline sympathetic to Mora- as if it's objectively a good thing for a changeling to conform to our understanding of intelligible life. I thought Star Trek was all about understanding, like, alien systems of living and self-actualizing, and learning to work through our differences with them and embracing the majesty of the universe. Instead we get that sister from the Blues Brothers.",startrek,1567552143,Kak_room,21,0,True,2019-09-03

pitch star trek picard seem like another streaming sci fi thing,"I criticized the trailer for feeling like more Discovery or a Disney/Marvelized Star Trek and a friend dared me to come up with an idea that didn't feel like those things, so here is my pitch for a new Star Trek show that only I would like, probably.

First of all, it's called STAR TREK: TRIUMVIRATE. Why? We'll get to that later, but calling it Picard is too on the nose and feels like we're relying on past Star Trek (And we are relying on past Star Trek, we just have to be smoother about it.)

Aight, so TRIUMVIRATE takes place in 2399ish. It's a period of *exceptional calm.* Basically nothing is going on. Klingons are on the verge of a civil war, but they always are so that's nothing new. They probably enjoy being on the verge of a civil war. Romulans have been real quiet for the past, let's say, *fifteen* years. Now, these are Romulans we're talking about and they're always up to some sneaky bullshit so we still have our eyes on them but everything seems pretty chill. The Federation? Well we're just kind of being humans, exploring the universe slowly and steadily. 

We first meet a Starfleet Cadet: Micas Linstrom. She's at Starfleet Academy but not to become a badass fighter pilot or anything - she's studying political science. In fact, she's terrified of space flight, but that's backstory to tackle later. She spends her time both in class and out of it studying the more obscure planets in The Federation, giving her a mostly useless knowledge and skill set.

At the onset of the series, we also meet some Federation brass. These guys, at the top of the Federation hierarchy have mostly become complacent due to the lack of threats in the galaxy. But all that changes when **A MYSTERIOUS ARTIFACT WITH THE POWER TO DESTROY WORLDS IS FOUND ON ZIRKWON IV**

No, just kidding. That doesn't happen.

We see news reports that a planet has voted to leave The Federation. Which planet? It's some bullshit planet like Pulgas II or something. It's a planet with no meaningful resources, no military importance and no real value to The Federation. Who cares about Pulgas II? 

The next day - it's Virion IV, then Cyberion. Planets are announcing their departure from The Federation at a steady pace, but none of these planets actually seem to *matter at all*. This news is met with a collective yawn. The Federation's high ranking officials aren't happy about it, but they couldn't really care less. In fact, some point out that these planets might be doing The Federation a favor by allowing them to expend resources on more ""useful"" planets. 

This news barely registers to anyone with the exception of our Cadet, Micas. She begins digging through records out of sheer curiosity and notices something *weird.* All these planets seem to have experienced a slow, but steady economic boom over the past...*fifteen years(ish)*, despite not having any meaningful increase in natural resources or technological abilities. She presents this information to her professor who immediately takes it to TOP MEN in The Federation. Upon learning this information, they cross-reference it with their own top-secret files and the answer clear: IT WAS THE (goddamn) ROMULANS.

Okay, see - fifteen years ago, the Romulans decided on a drastic change to their conquest tactics. Instead of military trickery, they would try economic trickery. They began a policy of funding pro Romulan politicians on various planets, interfering with elections and occasionally simply paying large sums of cash to dictators to join The Romulan Empire. The payments however, were contingent upon keeping the arrangements secret for a period of time, generally set to be fifteen years. In a later episode, we will learn the fate of one particular planet who attempted to renege on the deal and go public with the arrangement - but that's for later. Fifteen years later (now) and the other shoe has dropped and planets have begun leaving The Federation and joining The Romulan Empire.

This results in a change to how we understand The Neutral Zone. The actual demarcations of The Neutral Zone do not change - this is referred to as the De Jure Neutral Zone. However, because of the Romulan access to planet's deep in Federation territory, a De Facto Neutral Zone also exists. Romulans still do not send military ships into Federation territory, but they do send other ships and equipment, frequently using natural disasters or wars as an excuse to enter their territory. The Romulans are like YoU FeDeRaTiOn GuYs WoUlDnT StOp Us FrOm PrOvIdInG aId WoUlD u????...but actually they're sneaking in all kinds of missiles and cloaking devices, creating forward military bases. These dudes are sooo sneaky.

Anyways, The Federation comes to a conclusion: They gotta expand their reach, and that means changing the process and requirements for joining The Federation. They're going to have open up Federation membership to a wider variety of species and maybe even start thinking outside of the box in regards to what they consider to be intelligent life. And maybe even...The Prime Directive has to be ignored in pursuit of this. MAYBE. We don't know yet. We're gonna see, okay? Wait a few episodes, the issue will probably come up. Anyways, The Romulans' expansion is entirely too aggressive to just passively wait for planets and species to reach out, then put them through a battery of tests, first contact protocols, etc. We have to make these decisions quickly and decisively, the bureaucracy must come to an end! They decide to put the power into the hands of one man, who can be trusted to make these decisions with a level head - but who????????????????????????????

They consult with Micas and her partner (Note: I have not talked about her partner because it's unnecessary background detail - but it is important to know that he is assigned to her by The Federation officials. She's not into it.)  to help make the choice. They begin going through Starfleet records - and this is where you drop all kinds of neat little easter eggs, like you have them look at Barclay's record and it shows him having a bunch of awards for bravery in battle or something, that kind of stuff, hehehe - and they find a bunch of candidates but none of them are quiet perfect. Then they come to Picard. ""Wouldn't he be perfect for the role?"" Of course, but he'd never take the job, especially considering...HOW HE LEFT STARFLEET (Setting up the mystery for later, obviously.)

But they gotta at least ask. So they teleport to France and meet Picard in his vineyard. He's screwing around with his grapes when they arrive, naturally. They ask him if he'll take the job and he declines - why would he want to have that much pressure on his shoulders, single handedly deciding if a planet or a system should be allowed into The Federation? Besides, that's what dictators, like Pol Pot and &lt;Insert some Cardassian here&gt; do, right? BUT, Picard, didn't your success in Starfleet result from your subordinates having to obey you? Here, Picard gives them a tongue lashing about earned power versus given power, etc etc etc. But after thinking it over, Picard says that he will think about it, but that the power can't be his alone. He needs to share the power while still not allowing bureaucracy to weigh the process down. He needs a...**TRIUMVIRATE.**

So what the fuck is Star Trek: Triumvirate? The basic format of each episode is that Picard gets the initial details of a new species, planet or culture that is being considered for inclusion in The Federation. But who is in his Triumvirate? Well that changes each episode. Based on the initial details, he chooses two others to round out the decision making process - this will serve as a great excuse to bring back past characters. For example, in the pretty crappy The Next Generation Episode ""Half a Life"", we meet a species that kills off their people when they turn 60. Now, in Western medicinal cultures, this is an obvious violation of the Hippocratic oath, but is that reason enough to exclude them from The Federation? To help answer this question he might bring in Julian Bashir and The Doctor. They would discuss the philosophical and ethical concerns, with one conveniently being for and the other against the inclusion of the race, probably. Because that's easier to get some quality drama out of. 

The Triumvirate would, throughout the episode get more information to inform their decision. But where is that info coming from? In this show, and in real life, Picard is an old ass man. He's not going to be having crazy space adventures. In fact, as part of his agreement to even do this, he doesn't even have to leave his vinyard if he doesn't want to. The Triumvirate members come to him (Except in rare occasions where we want to shoot in some visually interesting place - perhaps they go to a rainforest when discussing a culture that pollutes with wanton recklessness, damaging the solar system around them.) So he can't get the information himself.

The information gathering is instead handled by THE AWAY TEAM. This is where we fill out the cast with young, hip, hot chicks and hot dudes who wear leather and uppercut and roundhouse kick people off balconies and dive in slow motion while shooting phasers, or whatever. You know what I mean, the people we put on the posters to look cool with lens flares and explosions. I don't really care about that part of Star Trek but ya gotta do it or CBS will cancel you for a spin-off of The Amazing Race. By the end of each episode, using the information gathered by The Away Team and consulting with the other Triumvirate members, Picard would make a decision on if the species would be allowed into the Federation.

Anyways, remember our cadet? She's on The Away Team. Despite her crippling fear of space travel - it's not the space travel that scares her really, it's the infinite blackness, the void. Why? That's episode 4, hold your horses, dude - she is assigned to The Away Team because of her knowledge of obscure planets that others, with their eyes on political appointments and the like have not bothered to study. Oh, also on The Away Team? VASH. That's right, Vash is gonna be Cadet Micas' badass space mommy who will guide her through her exploration of the universe using the knowledge she picked up from her time with Q. Oh, also on The Away Team? The partner assigned to her by The Federation - could he have ULTERIOR MOTIVES??? Also a fucking android dude. Androids in Star Trek rule, so there will be an android. And I guess an alien guy. Gimme a Benzite. Those guys are funny.

couple thoughts critiques best episode star trek,"Take Me out to the Holosuite.

 Okay, I'll concede that it might not be the best, but it's definitely my favorite. 

Thought one: That National Anthem was fucking dope and I'm kind of upset that we never hear it again. I'm assuming it was supposed to be the Federation's anthem, so I really think it could have been worked in elsewhere.

Thought two: Bashir should have been the pitcher. He's genetically enhanced and can play darts like nobodies business. Sisko even states that both he and Worf are as strong as a Vulcan. He should be evenly matched with them and at the very least be getting on base, if not knocking them out. 

Thought three: An all-Vulcan crew seems strange, out of place, and kind of against Federation ideals. Like, wouldn't that raise some red-flags in the Admiralty? A captain who wrote several papers while at the Academy about how Vulcans are better than humans starts assembling an all-Vulcan crew? Oh, this dudes a racist..probably shouldn't be a captain.

star trek beyond greatest failing fault never used greatest promotional weapon,"I love Star Trek Beyond. It’s the best of the nu-Trek movies (which for the record have a much better average than the prime timeline movies). I think it’s genuinely one of Trek’s best, and very much in-line with franchise values.

But I can not and will not ever forgive the studio for fucking up Beyond’s promotion so totally and completely. 

First you have them giving away the ending in the third trailer. Then you have them basically not promoting it at all, despite the 50th anniversary.

And lastly, thought I admit this is very personal because she is my absolute favorite music act ever, I absolutely loathe how Star Trek wastes Rihanna. In Summer 2016, Robyn Rihanna Fenty was no worse than the third biggest pop star on the planet (and likely 2nd). She has crossover appeal like NO ONE ELSE EVER ASSOCIATED with Star Trek (more than Iman, more than Sir Patrick, more than H Jon Benjamin, Jeri Ryan, anyone). She dutifully donned a TOS shirt and spoke on camera (!!!) about watching the show with her father and what it meant to her.

Sure, it’s totally fair to point out she likely isn’t a Trekker/ie, but I don’t need her to be able to pilot the ship out of space dock or that the lattice reconfiguration of dilithium crystals was supposed to introduced in the next class starship. But she still wore the shirt(s), sang the song and spoke about Trek.

That ‘Sledgehammer’ video is gorgeous and she LOOKS THE ENTERPRISE IN THE FACE. Fun fact! She wore a DS9 shirt out in LA during the release. But there was zero effort made by Paramount to leverage anything she did. It’s absolutely shameful, and further evidence that Paramount/CBS/Viacom have zero idea how to actually leverage Star Trek and grow the fan base.

star trek voyager frustrating series spoilers,"I'm re-watching Voyager, and am midway through season 4. I want to cry or scream at the showrunners. I cannot get over how glorious this show and entire franchise could have been if it was written today (I'm 32, I'm not ""new"" to it). 

I don't mean ""moodier""... but perhaps more realistic, and certainly - show the consequences! Show the effects of experiences and traumas. I understand television was done differently in the past, AND Star Trek has always been a bit ""simple"" - loosely tackling social issues each series... but it's frustrating and almost universe breaking to have the characters seemingly forget the past. 

  
Random examples for anyone interested in reading/debating:

&amp;#x200B;

1. The crew gets stranded by the Kazon. Not only do the crew seem barely phased, but that shit would traumatize and break so many people. They're already stranded in the Delta Quadrant, and their one hope is ripped from them by a double spy (Seska). The reactions from every cast member were ""meh"" (of course I blame the writing). Also, the Kazon basically vanish after S03E01 (**Basics Part II**). I think they're referenced once afterwards. 
2. Torture. So many crew members have some heinous shit happen to them, and RARELY is it ever addressed again. Consider B'Elanna. She has her DNA split by the Vidiians, is tortured... and only brings it up again once they meet another Vidiian later on. Oh, also the Doctor basically drugs her in an episode (**Darkling)**. They laugh it off. AND THAT'S NOT THE ONLY TIME! Torres has to deal with that crazy hologram who kills his crew (**Revulsion**) . She ALSO has to deal with the crazy ""programs"" in **The Thaw**. You're telling me that doesn't take a toll?
3. Tom gets sucked into the fold between space and subspace. We get one comment on this historical event. No creative description, and never mentioned again. - not to mention the million times he saves the ship. This mofo has saved the entire crew or at least tried to about 5 times by season 4.5. How come he's not walking around with a golden halo?
4. Background actors/replacing crew. Every time a main character has to take their station, they simply bump the person out of the way. No thanks, no nod, there's no interaction - the background characters are empty - and it makes the ship, universe, and show feel empty. *I did notice eventually the showrunners start re-using some of the same people across a season, which is nice. (And I know the Maquis trainees somewhat return in later seasons, i.e. Chell, after the game* ***Elite Force*** *was released).*
5. Q! The Q Continuum.... holy hell. Janeway helps end a civil war, and partially save the UNIVERSE - and she meekly asks ""Hey Q, send us home?"" They can do it. Q introduced the Borg to the Federation, and it has had lasting repercussions in the Trek Universe. He can't send a single ship back home? And Janeway mentions it. Barely. Sorry... but re-watching the first episode, the act of stranding Voyager is weak at best. At this point, after all the crap they've been though - take 45 minutes and explain to us in a heated debate among the crew why Q can't or shouldn't. That should be brought up at EVERY staff meeting. 
6. **Investigations** \- Paris treats Chakotay like shit for several episodes. Janeway and Tuvok lie to him. And when they reveal why - it's a weak reason, AND he gets a line or two of minor outrage over the deception - and then they move on and never address it. Also, I should note that fucking NEELIX ruined the entire plan, accidentally deals with the traitor - completely overriding all the effort and espionage and plan put together to get Paris on a Kazon ship. .... never addressed again.
7. Remember above when the Voyager crew got stranded in the Delta Quadrant? Remember when the Kazon marooned them? Well it happens AGAIN in **Displaced**, with the crew being ""trans-relocated."" There should be crew crying in corners, shuddering from the trauma. Instead, they lounge around like it's the holodeck.
8. KES! **Before and After/Year of Hell.** If she remembers the bogus ass future shown in the episode - fuck the Prime Directive, she's not Starfleet. She should provide Voyager with every goddamn detail and expectation. Never addressed again. She lived the future. Doesn't come up again.
9. Chakotay gets stranded on at least THREE FUCKING PLANETS aside from what I just mentioned (once with Janeway, the former Borg, some civil war). Wouldn't this take a toll, or at least tire someone out?
10. **DEADLOCK.** Harry Kim. and Voyager itself. I'm sure most of us love Battlestar Galactica. What they did right was show the damage to the ship. The amount of shit Voyager goes through - it should be a husk. ESPECIALLY after Deadlock when literal bulkheads are collapsing, and every piece of the ship is blasted apart... and then there's Harry Kim. So far they've never brought it up again that he's from an adjacent reality/universe.  


You get the idea. Thanks for reading. At least the Paris and Torres relationship is consistent and helps anchor me. #shipping

  I am watching an episode of DS9 where jake bring a dabo girl home to his father, commander sysko.

  I've heard quite a bit that dabo girls have a negative reputation, but from what I can tell reading online, they just seem to run the dabo tables and use their charm/beauty to separate clientele from their cash.

  It seems no different to me than a hooters girl.  Is there no difference, or do dabo girls, ya know, go the extra mile?

think strategy getting series efficient quality focused manner,"Here's the rub:  I have deep respect for the legacy of Star Trek, having watched TNG, DS9, and Voyager with mild attention when my father watched them during my childhood, and I want to experience the series myself as a whole now that I'm grown up.  The catch is, this is a dated style of television - not infrequently the ""monster a week"" approach of quantity over quality, and much of the material (particularly the older stuff) strikes me as honestly plodding, of middling quality, and likely to detract from my overall enjoyment if I tried to watch every.  single. episode.

So here's a strategy I've developed:  I'll only watch episodes rated as above average.  I can use [this website](https://www.ratingraph.com/tv_shows/star_trek-28350/), which plots the IMDB ratings of each episode of a TV series, to see which episodes in each season rank above and below the overall average for that season.  Using this methods, I can avoid everything below average in a given run.

What do you think?  Will I miss any really important classic episodes in TOS or TNG using these method?  Will I have to abandon it during DS9 due to the more serialized nature of the plot?  I've seen some lists online of ""essential"" episodes but they rarely seemed complete or consistent with one another.

Then we get to Voyager that is taking place in the same time period and regular EMH completely blows Data out of the water. Even Doctor from early seasons is much more advanced than Data. Data doesn't get sarcasm or figures of speech, Doctor is nothing but sarcasm. Data doesn't understand jokes, Doctor can tell them. Data doesn't feel without his emotion chip upgrade, EMH can love. It seems like the only thing that was holding EMH back is the amount of data it can accumulate. As soon as Doctor started to work as a full time crew member and accumulate data without purging it, it quicly became more human than human. If someone picks an episode of Voyager without knowing anything about the show, they would think that Doctor is just another crew member. Data on the other hand would standout as not being human just by the way he behaves and speaks (and not his skin and eyes color).

new fan love tos disappointed tng start,"I know it's supposed to get better after the second season but I needed to tell someone how disappointed I am.  I just finished watching TOS on Netflix and I was blown away by how amazing some episodes have been.

Now I watched the first two episodes of TNG (I will get to the movies too at some point) and my oh my is it a different beast.

First of all, the pilot is a long jumbled mess made of character exposition and a flimsy plot randomly enforced by the Q, who not only has no reason to be there but is so reminiscent of Trelane that it feels like a ripoff. I am usually forgiving of pilots, but comparing it back to it's equivalent(s) The Cage and Where No Mas Has Gone before, I cannot leave it off the hook.

Then the second episode is a rehashing of The Naked Time and they even admit that in the episode! This was annoying and seems like the show is just trying to replicate the original, and badly at that. Also, I freaking hate Wesley Crusher and everything it represents and I literally rolled my eyes when he taught the ACTUAL engineer how to do her job amd saved the day, it was cringe worthy.

Also, although this is a minor complaint, the bridge of the new Enterprise feels too comfortable and luxurios. I was kind of in love with the submarine like feel of the original bridge. 

I know, I know, that I am complaining about something that aired before I was even born, and that TNG is beloved by millions and I am sure for good reason. It's just that as a newcomer to the show, who was instantly taken by TOS's ability to get across interesting concepts and with excellent story telling, the jump into TNG was a cold shower. Sorry for writing such a paragraph and kudos if you got here.

bit star trek story working,"So I have an idea for a story that takes place in the Star Trek universe. It doesn't involve any of the characters we've seen before and takes place about 35 years after the end of DS9 for time line reference. So as far as Trek goes, it's basically completely divorced from the main cannon. I had a bit of a creative bug bit today and typed up about a page or so of a scene that would likely be the first page of the story and serves as the start of the framing device for the story itself. Sadly that creative bug bit has worn off and I'm kind of slumped into ""Meh... I'll come back to it later."" So I figured I'd toss it up and see what sort of response I get to the tiny bit I do have.

 Captain  Jinjing Ramirez rubbed her temples in frustration. Leaning forward she brought her elbows to rest on her desk and look at the report. Her chief engineer, Lieutenant Commander Abioye Jamison, had delivered the report half an hour earlier. She had read it, momentarily entertained the possibility that Abioye had made a mistake with the tests, and then dismissed the idea. Abioye didn’t make those kinds of mistakes. He may try to dance like he has three left feet, but when it came to scientific analysis Abioye would have re-confirmed the test results himself after re-confirming the validity of the test itself. There was just no doubt. The isolinear chips, which weren’t scheduled to be manufactured for another 5 years yet, were in fact over 6,000 years old.

She tapped the fingers of her right hand on her desk in a lose 2 beat rhythm while resting her chin on her left hand. It was an unconscious habit she performed when she was puzzling through something. She sat at her desk for a long moment, fingers tapping out the beat in otherwise complete silence. Finally, she exhaled a deep breath.

“*Computer, begin captain’s log*.” She called out. 

“*Captains log, Stardate 82094.4. Back at the academy, Admiral Ty’lan was teaching Temporal ethics. I find myself wishing I could talk to him about this situation. Perhaps laying out the information will help me determine what I need to do.*” She began before taking a breath.

“*A week ago, we were approached by an unidentified ship. It took no threatening actions, and before we could initiate universal hailing, they hailed us. By name and in English. They knew the Mitchell was a Federation starship, and that I was the captain. The people of the ship then identified themselves has having come from a planet in a nei*ghboring system.” She quickly picked up a padd and tapped a series of commands to pull up some information.

“*According to records, the system sports 2 M-class planets with one of them supporting a humanoid race. 75 years ago, it looked like they were advancing toward warp travel and there was recommendation to consider initiating first contact within the decade. There is a follow up report stating that they had appeared to stop their progress toward Warp travel and so the recommendation had been withdrawn. There is no indication as to why they stopped, simply that they did.*” She slid the padd from her hand onto the desk.

“*I suppose that will be one more mystery to add to the list. The identified themselves as Grecarians and presented an ambassador named Da’Ruul that they said would help to ‘answer questions’. But what he provided; well it raises a great many questions.*” She picked up one of the isolinear chips from her desk and examined it.

Ambassador Da’Ruul had handed the series of 12 circuit chip over during our initial meeting, explaining that they were almost 6,000 years old. Jamison had confirmed that. The production codes on the chips themselves match Star Fleet format, but the specific codes on them were in recycling and were intended to be utilized for chips that had yet to be produced. According to Star Fleet engineering, chips with these production codes would be made in about 5 years. 

Ramirez explained all of this to the recording computer. According to what Ambassador Da’Ruul had explained, the chips had been preserved for the last six millennia. When Ramirez had asked the Ambassador how his people had gotten the chips, he said that Ramirez should view the records on them. 

Those records had turned out to be Star Fleet captains’ logs. Captains Logs of the USS Edward Mitchell. A Nova II class ship that was intended to be launched in 6 years. And, according to the logs on the chips, was to be captained by her current helm officer, Lieutenant Commander Hodoyan. 

Ramirez couldn’t stop herself from grinning as she mentioned Hodoyan being the captain of the Edward Mitchell. He was a capable officer and showed a lot of promise. His Benzite meticulousness allowed him to handle and mentally catalog a great many details about various situations while his eidetic memory allowed him to recall all those details with an almost computer like efficiency. She figured he would make a good first officer in the next year or so and be ready for command in about five.

watching ds meridian,"So I'm deep into my first watch of DS9 season 3 ([reviews here](https://vengonofuoridallefottutepareti.wordpress.com/2019/09/03/stds9-in-2019-season-3-part-1/)). There are highs (The Search two-parter!), there are many mids (most episodes) and then there are some lows. Overall, the world feels lived in and complex and cozy and with so many episodes behind me hte mere accumulation has done its work and I'm comfortable being around these characters -- although it can be a bit too ""a day in the life""/soap opera in many cases -- certainly it's a completely different format from TNG, where the self-contained ""SF adventure of the week"" made things more exciting, and TNG's highs were higher than DS9's if I may say (at least for now)...

Well, Meridian: I had many issues with this episode. And I expect to get downvoted.

“I was admiring…your markings…If you don’t mind me asking…how far down do they go?” “All the way.”

In the main story, the *Defiant* discovers a planet which phases in and out of ‘our plane of existence’ every 60 years, and Dax very quickly falls in love with one of its inhabitants and decides to leave everything — everything! — behind and join him in that parallel existence. It’s sudden, I don’t know if it’s the acting or the writing or both but the melodrama is not very believable, and it’s full of technobabble that make you feel how much this is more fantasy than science. Dax is often defined by her being a beautiful woman more than anything else, and it’s the case in this episode as well. I feel Dax's stories have potential but are not well-exploited.

In the second story, an alien is sexually infatuated with Kira and orders Quark to make him a holosuite program with a virtual recreation of Kira, for his own sexual reasons, so Quark has to stalk Kira in order to capture her likeness. Again, a story that by today’s standards would be categorized as completely sexist (or at least it would be acknowledged in the dialogue that these are sexual predators and it’s not for laughs).",startrek,1567781838,orodromeus,18,6,True,2019-09-06

bit star trek story working,"Well I was going to post the updated material in a response to my original post... but apparently comments are limited to 10,000 characters. So I have to make a new thread apparently.  So new version of the teaser tidbit I posted yesterday.

 Captain Jinjing Ramirez rubbed her temples in frustration. Leaning forward she brought her elbows to rest on her desk and looked at the report. Her chief engineer, Lieutenant Commander Abioye Jamison, had delivered it half an hour earlier. She had read it, momentarily entertained the possibility that Abioye had made a mistake with the tests, and then dismissed the idea. Abioye didn’t make those kinds of mistakes. He may try to dance like he has three left feet, but when it came to scientific analysis Abioye would have re-confirmed the test results himself after re-confirming the validity of the test itself. There was just no doubt. The isolinear chips, which weren’t scheduled to be manufactured for another 5 years, were in fact over 6,000 years old.

She tapped the fingers of her right hand on her desk in a lose 2 beat rhythm while resting her chin on her left hand. It was an unconscious habit she had when she was puzzling through something. She sat at her desk for a long moment, fingers tapping out the beat in otherwise complete silence. Finally, she exhaled a deep breath.

“Computer, begin captain’s log.” She called out. 

“Captains log, Stardate 82094.4. Back at the academy, Admiral Ty’lan was teaching Temporal ethics. I find myself wishing I could talk to him about this situation. Perhaps laying out the information will help me determine what I need to do.” She took a breath before continuing.

“A week ago, we were approached by an unidentified ship. It took no threatening actions, and before we could initiate universal hailing, they hailed us, by name and in English. They knew the Venture was a Federation starship, and that I was the captain. The people of the ship then identified themselves as having come from a planet in a neighboring system.” She quickly picked up a PADD and tapped a series of commands to pull up some information.

“According to records, the system sports 2 M-class planets with one supporting a humanoid race. 75 years ago, it looked like they were advancing toward warp travel and there was recommendation to consider initiating first contact within the decade. There is a follow up report stating that they had appeared to stop their progress toward Warp travel and so the recommendation had been withdrawn. There is no indication as to why they stopped, simply that they did.” She slid the PADD from her hand onto the desk.

“So, one year they were on the cusp of achieving warp travel, and then they just stopped advancing in that direction. No indication as to what caused them to stop. Typically, such a change in development would be preceded by some sort of major disaster or social upheaval. But the Federation observation teams saw no evidence of such things. What made them stop work on Warp Travel when they did? I suppose that will be one more mystery to add to the list. Obviously sometime in the last 60 years they resumed work on warp travel and developed the technology enough to have interstellar ships.” Ramirez laid out her thoughts as she spoke the words. 

“The people from the ship identified themselves as Grecarians and presented an ambassador named Da’Ruul that they said would help to ‘answer questions’. But what he provided; well it raises a great many questions.” She picked up one of the isolinear chips from her desk and examined it.

Ambassador Da’Ruul had handed the series of 12 circuit chips over during our initial meeting, explaining that they were almost 6,000 years old. Jamison had confirmed that. The production codes on the chips themselves match Star Fleet format, but the specific codes on them were in recycling and were intended to be utilized for chips that had yet to be produced. According to Star Fleet engineering, chips with these production codes would be made in about 5 years. 

Ramirez explained all of this to the recording computer. According to what Ambassador Da’Ruul had explained, the chips had been preserved for the last six millennia. When Ramirez had asked the Ambassador how his people had gotten the chips, he said that Ramirez should view the records on them. 

Those records had turned out to be Star Fleet captains’ logs. Captains Logs of the USS Edward Mitchell. A Nova II class ship that was intended to be launched in 6 years. And, according to the logs on the chips, was to be captained by her current helm officer, Lieutenant Commander Hodoyan. 

Ramirez couldn’t stop herself from grinning as she mentioned Hodoyan being the captain of the Edward Mitchell. He was a capable officer and showed a lot of promise. His Benzite meticulousness allowed him to handle and mentally catalog a great many details about various situations while his eidetic memory allowed him to recall all those details with an almost computer like efficiency. She believed he would make a good first officer in the next year or so and be ready for command in about five. If the records were real, her estimation of his career path was accurate.

She picked up one of the translucent yellow chips and moved it between her fingers while she rolled the information around in her mind in some vein hope of coming upon an epiphany. All evidence pointed to a Star Fleet crew, led by Hoyodan, having major involvement with a developing society, even introducing new technologies. A major violation of the prime directive, and since time travel was apparently involved, likely a major violation of the temporal prime directive as well. The Grecarians wouldn’t have the isolinear chips otherwise. Even if the ship had crashed and the remains recovered, the materials used in the chips would have decayed and broken-down centuries ago. These chips had to be specifically preserved, which meant the people who preserved considered them to be important.

Ambassador Da’Rull had explained that at the time, many of the different tribes on his world’s northern continent was just entering the equivalent of the Iron age. An iron age society would have the technology to preserve something like the chips, but in most other cases that Ramirez knew of such efforts tended to be used for religious reasons, like the preservation of the remains of a God-king or similar. 

“Could they have believed that the chips were ‘gifts from the gods’ and were worth preserving?” she asked off handedly.

“There are insufficient parameters provided for that query. Please restate.” Ramirez jumped at the computer’s voice responding to her unintended question.

“Computer disregard.” She said as she slid the isolinear chip out of her hand and onto the surface of her desk. She rested her chin on her left hand for a long moment before she came to a decision. 

“Computer, pause captain’s log.” She commanded. The computer chimed in response halting the recording. 

“Let’s see what these logs actually say.” She said as she shorted the chips by production code and selected the one with the highest number on it. Typically, the higher the production number, the later the chip was inserted into the computer core and the newer the files on it. She hoped this also meant that this meant the logs on this chip talked about the events in the other chips. She slid the chip into the reader on her terminal. The screen blinked on and quickly listed the files on the chip. The logs were listed by stardate, stardates that were displaced by 6,000 years anyway. All except for the last file. It was listed with her name. 

In a moment of surprise, she sighed. Tapping a series of keys, she selected the file and had her terminal load the log. 

The screen flickered and finally filled with the image of Hodoyan. An aged, and much worse for wear version of Hodoyan it had to be noted. On the screen his skin was a dull grey brown with patches of red, whereas the officer that was presently in command of the ship had shiny blue skin with a few areas of brown at the edge of his upper lip and around the pronounced brows. The image of Hodoyan on the screen was missing his right eye, the organ apparently having been gouged out several years prior as evidenced by the dark brown scar tissue that ran from where the tendril would have been on that cheek, up through the socket and splitting the right brow. Whatever had taken his eye had apparently also taken the tendril on that side of his face. There were other smaller scars visible, while his remaining eye was quite sunken in its socket. The tendril coming from his left cheek was significantly longer then what Hodoyan had at present... well ‘present’ being the Lieutenant Commander Hodoyan that was currently sitting on the bridge. Ramirez wasn’t an expert on Benzite aging, but if she had to guess the Hodoyan displayed on the screen was around 80 years old, about 50 years older than he presently was. Quite old for a Benzite. 

Ramirez found herself not believing that the person on screen was the same person she was presently serving with. The Benzite on screen was battle worn and imagining a Benzite being involved in a war was itself difficult even more so for Hodoyan as he was a diplomate at heart. 

“Hello Jingjin. If my calculations are correct, you should be seeing this message just about a week after meeting the ambassadors of this world.” The older Hodoyan spoke. 

“That explains how they knew my name and the name of the ship.” Ramirez thought. 

“If my memory serves me still, I imagine you have a great many questions about this.” the recording spoke in long, deliberate syllables. Hodoyan took a long breath, the act producing a wet hissing sound. 

“Yes, these records have been deliberately preserved so that I may be judged for my actions. I confess that I am very curious how the judge advocate general’s office will even attempt to address my actions given the time. Can the Federation even judge actions from six thousand years ago?” Hodoyan chuckled slowly before coughing.",startrek,1567837539,TorroesPrime,0,1,True,2019-09-07

intersting theorie borg queens,"At some point the Borg were created by a species, (nanobot technology and hivemind dont appear out of tin air). So i think it would be really cool if the Queens are whats left of the first species. Here what i think happened (or at least it would be awesome)

The Borg were a subspace civilisation and at some point they created a way to be always connected so that they became more effective while retaining some of their personality, at one point they Found another civilisation and they wanted to share this technology, (or they just conquered them but i personally like a Idea of a peacefull species).
 But what they did not think was that the personality of the other species would just merge with the Borg and almost instantly the Borg had all the technology and personality of the other species. Wishing for every species to expérience the technology and link of the Borg they made their mission to Search for other species to assimilate into the Borg.
At that point the original species of the Borg were a fraction of the total population and since they still had some individuality or indépendance from the Borg collective they naturally became the Queen of the hive like a bee Queen influencing the drone in important décision but letting the collective decode on more trivial décision

That would be awesome i think and would give a reason as to why they Conquer everything

apparently something enterprise lived enterprise e,"I was watching *Nemesis* for he first time in several years yesterday, and noticed that observation lounge / briefing room on the Enterprise E was actually the same set used for the Enterprise D, just heavily modified/redressed, but still retaining a lot of familiarity. And after doing some checking, it was also seen in *First Contact*, albeit with much tighter angles than in *Nemesis*, where it they made it feel more like in an episode of *TNG*.

It is kinda of nice to know that not all of the *TNG* sets were trashed in the making of *Generations*. That lounge set feels rather special in a way, perhaps because of how it transcended TV shows and the films, making it's big screen debut as the dining hall in *Star Trek VI, The Undiscovered Country* (where it *did* get sort of trashed, but returned to it's true form not long after.)

It's also nice that it was actually restored to it's TNG glory in the final episode of *Enterprise*, where they had recreated some part of the Enterprise D.

I do wonder what they finally did with that set? Is it sitting around in storage somewhere at Paramount?

imo borg worldending threat think,"Disclaimer first: There is a good chance Picard invalidates everything I say in here and makes me look stupid. Fair enough. :)
It's still what I'm going to work with with an AU fanfiction I'm working on.

Okay, how much the kick in the gonads delivered to them by Future!Janeway in Endgame actually inconveniences the Collective is something that's often lead to heated debates, and I'm aware that I might start another one, but I'm one of those who thinks that the Borg Collective is cripled for the relative long-term.

My way of approaching these things is ass-backwards, but bear with me. This is also me massively nerding out about Star Trek. :)


*-There is more than one Borg Queen and destroying one didn't really criple the Borg after First Contact.*

True, I actually agree. Even if Memory Aplha didn't state that there were multiple Queens, it would be criminally negligent for a thing like the Borg who prizes redundancy and distributed computing (for lack of a better word) like they do to risk the survival of the whole like that. Did it hinder them? Slow them down? In First Contact's context? No, probably not all that much, but we have no information to know for sure. In my opinion the Borg wouldn't risk even one of several Queens on the frontlines against a species who has managed to be very good at resisting in the past. Nor would they risk another trojan horse attack like what happened with Locutus, so they probably had a spare Queen ready and activated her when contact with the Cube was lost.

You also have to keep in mind please that the Borg episodes of Voyager took place around the time of First Contact, i.e. in 2373, (which is probably the reason why only one cube was sent to Earth instead of a dozen, as the Borg were a mite busy with Species 8472 at the time), and Voyager encountered the 2nd Borg Queen in 2375, so there definitely was some sort of contingency in place.


*-The virus thingamagic Future!Janeway used couldn't infect the entire collective, it didn't have time/the incident was too isolated.*

Here I actually mostly disagree. In Endgame, the Borg Queen gave no indication that she'd lost contact to the collective until she was infected by the virus, so with what little information we have, we have to assume that she controlled everything even then. Frankly, it feeds into my response to the redundancy thing. There is no way the Borg Queen would be nuts enough to knowingly go anywhere where she's cut off from the hive. Given how she reacted to prior attempts to sever parts of the collective, it's save to say risking it that way wouldn't be in her nature.

Now did the virus infect everything and kill every single drone? No, probably not. If it proliferated itself across the Borg Network in anything like an IRL computer virus did (minus depending on idiots opening random e-mail attachments or skeevy porn sites of course) then it would still take time even with Borg communications factored in. We know that Borg ships or small groups of Drones can form their own mini-collective, of course there's probably a large chunk of the Collective who did this as the rest of the hive started going off-line. 

And then there's always random chance.

TLDR being that I think that the Virus could have infected the entire collective but probably didn't both because of random chance and things in the real world just not working out that perfectly.

These are of course only the two most common arguments I have encountered.

So what happened with the Borg?

I think that between everything, the virus and the destruction of the transwarp network the collective was dealt a not quite mortal blow. They lost a huge number of ships and drones because of the events of Endgame, and I think that the losses they took will take them a century or two to make good, if not more.

In the end, I think the thing that really crippled them was the Transwarp getting kablooeyed by Voyager. Yeah, the first Cube attacking the Federation in BOBW didn't use the apeture that close to Earth and nor did the one in First Contact, but they did use others to get close to Federation space. We know that the Borg have transwarp tech that doesn't rely on the network, but  we don't really know how long it took Voyager to traverse those 20k light years. Once again I'm applying some logic to this by saying that if the Transwarp tech as fitted to Borg ships were a faster and more efficient way to move ships across the entire galaxy, then the Borg wouldn't be using the Network. 

Think of the transwarp coils as technology for tactical movement whereas the network was strategic. With it, you could  dump entire fleets in spitting distance from Earth, yes. But from there you'd still need warp drive to attack Vulcan or the rest of the Federation core worlds.

So the Collective's ability to coordinate among itself, communicated in large groups and then quickly move said troops through the Galaxy without giving anyone any forewarning is gone, and to an extent won't be coming back anytime soon.
Borg are still dangerous and probably will be until the end of time, but I think that we likely shouldn't be seeing any sort of coordinated attack on the Alpha Quadrant powers any time soon. At least for the remainder of the 24th and all of the 25th Century. If ever. Ideally, all that's left is single or small groups of Borg ships randomly roaming about the Delta Quadrant.

And even if they come back one day, we're talking about a faction that, even in the non-memetic, non TV form, managed to develop Borg buster torpedoes within less than a lifetime. By the time they are in any shape to look outward again and move beyond their tech stagnation, the Federation will be an entirely different beast for them to fight.",startrek,1567885311,trekchu,2,1,True,2019-09-07
tonight discovered arena low budget sci fi featuring marc alaimo dukat villain armin shimerman quark right hand man,"I'm not sure why I decided to click on this while browsing Netflix but I'm glad. It's essentially Bloodsport in spaaaaaace, and while it's hardly the best film I've ever seen it's very watchable. The outer space special effects are absolutely *awful* but it features some surprisingly decent creature designs, makeup and costumes (with a few exceptions).

Of course the real attraction for a Trekkie is seeing the glorious duo of Marc and Armin acting together years before DS9. Marc plays an alien underworld boss whose character and performance isn't a million miles removed from Dukat, albeit with some atrocious makeup and a silly costume (it's essentially Marc painted silver, sporting a naff haircut and wearing a suit that makes him look like a futuristic butler). As the title says, Armin plays his right-hand man, er, alien who looks a bit like a rat with suitably Ferengi-esque sharp teeth. The makeup is far better than what poor Marc has to put up with, and even though it covers his entire head you can still instantly recognise Armin even before he speaks. 

So yeah, if you're curious to see Quark and Dukat: The Early Years and are in the mood for a cheesy 80's sci-fi then this is your film!

walter mosley circumstances departure disco shows incapable writing staff,"So after reading up on the circumstances of Mosleys departure from DISCOs writing staff I was so Pissed as I usually am with the writing of DISCO so pissed that I decided to make my first post ever on Reddit about it. 

For all who don't know Walter Mosley he is a Jewish African-American who is most known for writing crime novels and was also one of the writers for DISCO.

Walter Mosley was essentially forced to resign recently because he told a story where he was pulled over by the police where the police officer explained that ""he stopped all n—-rs in paddy neighborhoods and all paddies in n—-r neighborhoods, because they were usually up to no good,""

""I just told a story about a cop who explained to me, on the streets of Los Angeles, that he stopped all n—-rs in paddy neighborhoods and all paddies in n—-r neighborhoods, because they were usually up to no good,""  
- Direct quote from Walter Mosley from the New York Times

After retelling this story (which which is don't get me wrong is appalling which continues to show how broken American the American judicial system is) another member of the writing staff made an offial complaint against him saying ""it made them feel uncomfortable"".

And ladies and gentlemen is part of the problem with the writing of DISCO and everybody or almost everybody on the writing team. They are unfortunately to PC to much in need of there safe space to afraid to talk about real issues and I understand that safe safes can be a useful thing but when it come to writing a show about hard issues like racism and sexism and injustice your safe space and fear of a tiny little 6 letter world has no place there as it ruins what makes trek so good when you can't face the harsh issues and write about them in an effort to help solve them.

Think about what ""Past tense"" would be without the ability to face the gap between wealthy and poor or what ""Rejoined"" would be like without the ability to look at same sex relationships or ""Far beyond the stars"" without Siskos struggle with being a black man in 1950s New York. (Can you tell my favourite star trek is DS9).

Those episodes simply don't work without the ability to examine those issues and star trek would not be known for its previous ability and willingness to deal with these issues if all the ""Golden Age"" trek writers were made uncomfortable to the point of making an official complaint whenever they heard about a word that made them feel uncomfortable. Star Trek would not be one of the best if not the best piece of science fiction ever made if it did not used to have this such incredible ability to cover these harsh issues and relate them to us to make us examine ourselves and how we interact with people.

How are the writers of DISCO meant to tackle these real issues if they themselves are unable to tackle these issues in their own heads.

think valiant,"DS9 S6 E22 

I finished my first watch through of this episode last night and thought it was quite good. After, I did some reading through some old posts here and found that some people had a lot of issues with it, so I watched it a second time today and I still think it manages to hold up.

I suppose I just want to start a general discussion on the episode. What did you like or dislike? What held the episode back and what could have made it better?

Personally, I loved it. I thought the episode was exciting and did a good job of telling the story of Red Squad. I didn't feel like this episode took place on the Valiant with Red Squad just because, I felt as though the reasoning for the episode was solid and made sense. The In-over-their-head and somewhat arrogant Red Squad wanted to finish the mission, and the end was certainly unexpected for me and has given Nog some serious development.",startrek,1567907587,BaconCola,46,16,True,2019-09-07

first tos complete watchthrough,"I grew up with TNG and later series, but for whatever reason I had never watched all the way through TOS. I had seen individual episodes on TV or VHS at various times. I wanted to share my thoughts:

It took me a year or so on and off. For whatever reason TOS isn’t as “bingable” for me as TNG or DS9. 

The costume design is something I’ve never seen anywhere else. The women’s costumes are especially revealing. Some of the men’s costumes are revealing too-- like that space-hippie from the Way to Eden who got a miniskirt. The uniforms look a lot more comfortable than the TNG era jumpsuits-- like you could actually wear something like that on a regular basis.

Set design: The enterprise still looks good, and futuristic to my mind. A lot of touch screens like they had in disco will probably look dated eventually. 

Cinematography: The lighting is interesting. They used a lot of colored gels, and in some cases will do a very tight shot and light only the eyes. They were a lot less concerned that the lighting appear like it could come from the environment of the shot. Compared to modern TV where cameras are very mobile, the shots are very fixed. . 

Casual sexism: Women can’t be starship captains? Jack the Ripper’s ghost targets women because they’re “more emotional.” The show is progressive in some ways, but shows its age in others. 

Kirk: Kirk doesn’t hook up with quite as many women as people joke about. He’s also a better captain than I remember. He makes some weird decisions, but for the most part his decisions make some kind of sense, he’s fair, and he tries diplomacy first. I think his reputation as an action hero comes from every planet he beams down to having someone knock him out and steal his communicator and phaser. 

Spock: The writers always seemed to be trying to find ways to put Spock in situations where he’s compromised and will show emotion. He’s kind of not that nice to his friends and very dismissive of humans. The main tension with McCoy comes not from him being stoic, but when he needs to make a decision that McCoy sees as heartless. When it’s reasonable to assume that the captain is dead, and McCoy wants to keep looking but there are other deadlines to adhere to, Spock prioritizes the other deadlines. 

McCoy isn’t as hotheaded as I remember. Most of his positions are well reasoned, but he argues for them passionately. 

Stories: In TNG and later there was more character growth through the series, and there were more stories driven by character interactions than TOS where there’s a lot more stories based just on the weirdness of external circumstances. The main characters are pretty much the same people at the end of TOS that they are at the start. I can’t really say that of TNG, DS9, VOY, or ENT. 

Continuity: a semi-coherent continuity isn’t something that they seemed to care about until later in TNG. Even then they felt okay retconing some stuff. TNG gave an explanation for why most species look human, but I don’t know if there was ever an explanation for why some civilizations are almost exactly parallel to Earth. Modern/Ancient Rome planet, for example. 

Vs. Trek 2009: I think TOS is the clear winner for me. For whatever reason recasting the main actors and making everything shiney feels cynical to me. I’m okay with the action-- TOS had fistfights almost every episode, after all. The story just doesn’t do much for me.

Plus the campiness of TOS make accepting some of the weird plot stuff easier for me. It's fun, so it doesn't matter too much that something or other doesn't make sense. The 2009 series has jokes, but they're self aware, and everything feels ""heavier,"" and less fun.",startrek,1567954490,fleemfleemfleemfleem,3,10,True,2019-09-08

got star trek one best decisions life,"**TL;DR: I finally got to watch Star Trek and it is the most mesmerizing piece of fiction I delved into.**

Hi, I'm 26 years old, found myself in a bit of a cultural void where I felt I couldn't understand enough references, easter eggs and memes. So I crafted myself a small excel file with various sheets in it, each containing a list of every single movie, TV show and video game (as well as every book, comic book, anime show and manga - but in a smaller scale) that I've ever read/watched in my life, but mostly it was made to keep track of all the numerous recommendations and 'must-see'-s of titles that I deemed historically, academically and artistically important. A Movie-and-TV-show list specifically is over 1000 titles long with almost 600 of those waiting to be seen, including Star Trek: TSO

Last year I've decided to take a chronological approach and get myself familiar with the titles starting from the earliest (it being Fritz Lang's Metropolis, 1927). A couple of weeks ago I've finally got to the year 1966 and started watching TSO and honestly this is one of the best pieces of television I've seen. Yes the acting is a bit stiff and the rocks are made of styrofoam but the meticulously detailed and virtually perfect personality-idolizing machine-condemning retrofuturistic universe of the late 60s is so warm and fascinated I'm basically glued to the screen for tens of hours already.

I've picked the 'correct' order (TOS→TAS→Films (1-6)→TNG→*Generations* (Film #7)→DS9→VOY→Films 8-10→ENT→Films 11-13→DSC) and I'm having a pretty rad time.

It's a Great show.

fever dreamt strangely cool ds episode,"I'm sick and binge watching DS9. It was an awful night but the fun thing is I had a DS9 dream, a whole new episode, I even remember the title: 

Who Cries Wolf.

It kinda even made sense, and I think it was pretty cool, so I wanted to share it.

So it started with a field of debris from a Federation starship in the Gamma Quadrant. We see a Jem'Hadar ship inspecting it and receiving a transmission. In it, the captain of the near-destroyed ship (we see explosions on the bridge) says that they stumbed upon something that looked like a decloaking ship. They raised shields to maximum, thinking it's Klingons or perhaps Jem'Hadar, but this wasn't a cloaked ship. It was some kind of anomaly, and raising shields caused it to fry everything on the ship. The captain warns: if you see something decloaking here, don't raise shie... BOOOM! End of transmission.

The Jem'Hadar look puzzled and suddenly something starts slowly decloaking. After a short discussion they lower their shields, believing this is the anomaly. Then BAM, it's Defiant that decloaks and blows the Jem'Hadar into smithereens. 

It was Kira's brilliant trap, a guerilla-style setup. Another JH ship scratched (for some reason she is hunting Jem'Hadar on the Defiant).

Long story short, our Federation heroes destroy a couple of others Jem'Hadar ships this way, creating a believabe transmission that some anomaly destroyed a ship because it raised shields, then starting to decloak, and then, when Jem'Hadar have shields lower, firing at them.

But eventually the Defiant comes upon a Jem'Hadar ship with no power, just floating there, claiming that a similar anomaly actually appeared and only after lowering shields they were able to survive.

Is this a trap? How could they know about this scheme, if there were no witnesses to warn them?

And oh crap, something looks like it's starting to decloak!

So the Defiant has to choose whether to trust the Jem'Hadar and risk to fall into Kira's own trap, or to keep shields raised in case there is a ship waiting for them.

I don't know how it ended, though, I woke up.",startrek,1568019988,szuran,19,112,True,2019-09-09

character love much sisko really started wrong foot,"Aside from the original series, Star Trek seems to have a history of getting started on the wrong foot and having to course correct later. 

And my favorite series is no exception. Granted some of it was intentional but starting Sisko off by bashing the beloved Captain Picard was a risky move.

What is it with Star Trek and wanting to make the protagonist a jerk (and then having to fix it later)? Picard is insufferable in much of Season One. Sisko bashes Picard but this is after Picard has become likable in later seasons. Janeway was a Federation zealot. Archer was just overly emotional and impulsive to contrast T'Pol but came off looking stupid in the process.

Yet they all got better later. Even Enterprise with the Xindi arc and Season Four was starting to turn it around before they got canceled. 

 Its why I haven't completely written off the idea of watching Discovery again some day. Sure the show got off on the wrong foot but it might eventually get better like all Trek does (I'm following reviews of the series from someone I trust and it hasn't happened yet.)",startrek,1568030615,FreshContact,71,59,True,2019-09-09

,"So my first memory of Star Trek is extremely hazy, watching either TOS or TNG with my estranged father, and my second memory is of watching the 2009 reboot with him but waiting til he walked out of my life before I dared get into the fandom. The thing is, my dad is a total cunt, and would always purposely ruin things for me if I liked them, mainly by insulting me either directly or indirectly and poking fun- Alright, no, this isn't about my father.

My real problem is my inability to accept change, in no matter what form or context that change comes. (Note that I am not neurotypical.) 

The change could be something as similar as not running on the same street every morning because there's construction work there for a week, or it could be something like paying a hell of a lot of saved money through points over a new phone but feeling depressed because the interface doesn't match the interface of my original phone, leading me to use the original again even if there's the very real risk that it'll stop working at any moment. Unfortunately this also extends to the media I consume. You would not believe how I felt upon completion of Star Trek: Beyond, especially with that tribute at the end, because it forced me temporarily out of denial, and my heart ached for Nimoy. 

I've been rewatching both TOS and AOS, and while the reboot films are timeless, I'm afraid that when I finish the last TOS season (I just started it last night) I'll move onto the films, then run out of content (for their era) and feel miserable because I'm going to be pushed out of my denial and be forced to accept that these people are now long-dead. I could always rewatch, but it feels like I'm fooling myself most of the time. Should I get the novels? I have an app that has most of them, if not all of them, free of charge, and there are plenty of eBay sellers when it comes to original paperbacks.

That aside, despite it being my main concern, what should I watch after TOS? I originally intended to watch TNG but now I'm not sure if I'll be following the right order or not. Also I'm not a fan of DISCO, due to the bad writing, but I still have to finish it at some point.",startrek,1568101225,john_kennex,13,3,True,2019-09-10

ds wonderful one giant problem,"Rewatching DS9 after maybe 10 years. I was surprised how much I like it. Even the 1st season, which I remember as very mediocre, I enjoyed quite a bit.

But that's the thing. I enjoyed almost all 1st season episodes, even the dreaded Move Along Home, because there was no Dominion arc yet.

Once the Dominion arc started all I cared about was the episodes that advanced this meta plot and nothing else. Thing is....there's an apocalyptic galactic war threatening to eradicate a huge chunk of the Alpha quadrant life. I wanna see how it develops, how it ends. It's nail-biting. The stuff with Sisko's visions, the whole Bajor spiritual thing, the occupation of the station, the big battles, the Changelings, Vorta, Jemadar...

...and now the show wants me to care about Jake trying to fetch a baseball card for his dad? About Odo and Kira's love? About Worf and Jadzia marriage? About Bashir holosuit fantasies? About another tale of Quarks' greedy escapades?

I'm certain I'd enjoy all of those episodes if there was no meta-plot, because they are great characters and some of those episodes are very moving (like the ""Visitor"" about old Jake and his encounters with his time-travelling dad). But with the war looming all over the galaxy they seem utterly irrelevant, petty and pointless and I find myself skipping only to the episodes that move the Dominion plot along.

I expected there to be some sort of justification, like she's an empath and the baby is developing so quickly that she can already touch it's mind and feel an emotional connection with it (let's be honest, if anyone in the history of scifi characters is going to bond with their weird alien fetus, it's going to be Deanna Troi). Buuuuuut... nope! Pregnant now. It's fine. Also the new doctor is just entirely not weirded out by this at all apparently. Kid grows up really fast and Troi just kinda goes with it. Everyone just goes with it and is like ""huh well isn't that neato"" instead of ""WTF???"". Like, I know it was a being of energy that wanted to learn, but Troi was sexually assaulted and impregnated against her will in episode one of season two of this show and that is fucking weird as hell.

I'm not a big fan of Kes, I think the character wasn't played very well and had so much potential that wasn't realised in the writing. But the possibilities and stories that could come from such a short lived race are huge.

The role of tutor/guru that Seven of Nine ultimately fulfilled was well done and the performances of them both made it work.

penance error finished watching spocks brain sub rosa move along home amp threshold spoilers,"* Spocks Brain (TOS)

Putting aside all campiness, the episode had several (surprisingly) redeeming factors. For once, we see a mystery not easily solved by technobabble, not, of course, the focus, but there's a mystery after Spocks Brain is abducted as to which of three planets its Theives originated from. One, with technology roughly equivilent to Earths 15th century, another with technology close to our current era, and a third with no evidence of society or technology, but, with an energy emission they cannot identify. Kirk chooses (correctly of course) the third planet. Skipping some plot, we are presented with *yet another* of Treks staples, the ancient advanced civilization in decline/post-apocalyptic state. Interestingly, no mention of the Prime Directive is made despite the current residents being of near-stone age development, and Kirk arbitrarily decides to obliterate their known way of life and force them back into some semblance of what *he thinks* the natural order should be. This is something Kirk does for a hobby on a regular basis.

* Sub Rosa (TNG)

I could barely remember this one from my original watch when it aired so, I went into this one fairly fresh. A Scottish ghost story in space involving an alien energy being, generations of manipulation, the needless death of an innocent, the reanimation of a corpse, and Doctor Crusher enjoying a touchless fully clothed orgasm on screen. There's not a lot this episode doesn't have. That said, **not as bad as people say**. I rather enjoyed it. This is also the origin episode of that popular image of Troi &amp; Crusher stretching in unitards, which, while I understand they had to be doing *something* while they exchanged dialog, it was frankly a bad fit, should've been a simple conversation in Troi or Crushers office. The wrap up, as Crusher kills the anaphasic life form Ronin to protect LaForge from Green Electrocution, falls about as flat as one would expect. I liked the weather control subplot for explaining the dark and stormy atmosphere schtick though.

* Move Along Home (DS9)

An alien species with a penchant for games, Jake's growing into a young man, Bashir is incompetent, and *Quark saves the day*... Wait, what? Yep, **Quark**. So, the perils of Sisko, Dax, Bashir, and Kira in the game are, well, they're bad. Like, uninspired, cliche, homebrewed D&amp;D bad. The real action is outside the game, as Bashir can't find his dress uniform, Jake is noticing girls, and Odo proves yet again that he's the right man for the job, at least, until it turns out the whole thing was *just a game* and nobody was in any real danger, which they wouldn't have *had to go through at all except for Quark in the first place*. He tried to cheat, so the new aliens with the funny writing on their foreheads abducted the senior officers in the middle of the night and made them face trials while making Quark think he might be responsible for their deaths. I'm the end, Quark tries to do the right thing and get them out as quick as possible (after, of course, having a period of groveling on the floor), but fails and loses. But, again, just a game, no danger, and the whims thing was a waste of time. I'm curious about the Wadis relationship with the Dominion though. This is before the Dominion entered the lexicon, but the Wadi are from the Gamma Quadrant.

* Threshold (VOY)

Ok, so, this one's pretty much famous for its **glaring scientific errors** which almost eclipse the **giant plot holes** it introduces. I'll get to those in a moment. I just want to point out something I never see mentioned. Everyone in this episode acts like it's an after school special about self esteem. Paris, Kim, &amp; Torres think they've found a way to break the Warp 10 barrier. And they have, but all the simulations ended in disaster until Neelix gives them an idea that gives Paris &amp; Kim the solution. They simulate it, it works, everybody acts like that's stupid levels of wholesome gee golly willickers shucks that's super, they prep a test flight, Janeway makes Paris grovel to fly it, he does it, whoo-hoo the screw-up did something right, everybody be wholesome some more. Then, he dies, gets better, gets really bad eczema, kidnaps the Captain to a jungle planet where they ""evolve"" into weird red lizard things and make weird red lizard thing babies ***which everyone is totally ok with*** before the doctor fixes them both and they go on their merry way with the traditional episodic reset.

reading trek novels good idea terrible idea,"I'll preface this by saying that I read a LOT of Trek novels as a kid during the 90s - up until probably around 2000 or so, I read most, if not all of the books that came out.

I haven't read a Trek book in quite some time, however, and totally missed several of the bigger series (Destiny, Typhon Pact, Titan, the relaunches, etc.).  I've been debating going back and reading Trek books in chronological order, starting with The Entropy Effect (1981) and going forward.  Has anyone here attempted something like this?  It would obviously be a long-term project.

Is there a ton of filler in there that should be skipped, or is it valuable to read most/all of them?

I have some ground rules in mind, including skipping novelizations.  I can sometimes also get ""stuck"" on a book that I just don't really like that much as I read it more slowly and am not motivated to finish, so I might put a time limit on completing each book and move forward if it's just not for me.

fan theory concerning origin arrowhead insignia,"I'm probably not the first to notice, but I've never seen this before, so it's new to me. :)

It looks an awful lot like a cursive ""Little Yus"", a character that was discontinued in most Cyrillic-using languages except for a real-world constructed language called Interslavic (which as its name suggests, is meant to facilitate communication between Slavic language family speakers).

Little Yus has a phonetic value of 'e' which might have been used for a transliteration of the name Enterprise into Interslavic, possibly?

Here is a [representation of the cursive little yus](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/Handwritten_Little_Yus.svg&amp;imgrefurl=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Handwritten_Little_Yus.svg&amp;h=559&amp;w=397&amp;tbnid=aA6Rg9ZImou0TM:&amp;q=little+yus&amp;tbnh=90&amp;tbnw=63&amp;usg=AI4_-kR9d9gtsWBGFpq28HU_YTowSwNLww&amp;vet=1&amp;docid=9hF8ZHyEqM5fPM&amp;client=firefox-b-1-m&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjniOHOt8nkAhUHXa0KHchzDHEQ9QEwA3oECAkQCA#spf=1568229019182).

I wonder if Roddenberry inserted this as a little easter egg or subtle detail to support his future where the Cold War between East and West was ancient history, and that the Russians (or someone who used Interslavic) made a stylized Little Yus to be the ship insignia for the first NCC-1701.",startrek,1568229123,aqua_zesty_man,4,0,True,2019-09-11

apology question,"Okay so, first off, my question is at the end for people not so interested in ""life stories"".

I'm a Bond fan, also raised on Star Wars, and as someone with Asperger's I absolutely hated on Star Trek, because being compared to Spock wasn't flattering at all (same goes for Sheldon in TBBT) and I described it as looking like ""Jag in Space"". My partner was raised watching Star Trek and has a personal attachment to it. He resisted watching the Bond movies with me -- not out of malice, just boredom -- that I made an offer at the time I thought would be a good compromise. One Bond film for one Star Trek film, alternating nights until we finished them all. Halfway through Wrath of Khan I decided it was a bad idea.

Fortunately, The Voyage Home was an absolute blast, probably making me laugh as much as Anchorman, and I finally understood why the OG cast are so respected. I guess I started getting into it -- the silliness eased me into the fact that the series is more ideology than action. By the time we reached Nemesis I was still lying and saying it was ""just ok"", but internally, positively comparing the franchise to Bond due to how greatly the tone changes with each new cast, how some movies are more serious than others, how some of the entries are just plain fun, and how all of them reflect the time period they were made in, which is something I've only seen in Planet of the Apes and Bond (probably others, but not that I've seen).

Months later, he shows me Discovery. Actually, to be honest, on Monday he showed me Discovery, and we've almost finished it entirely. I'm yelling at the TV, complaining about Star Wars NOT doing certain things, and losing my shit at every plot twist (I'm also low key pleased that Stamets and Culber's relationship is both realistic and subtle enough that I've teared up more than once). Every character interaction is intriguing and satisfying. (I understand opinion on the series is divided, hence the last part of this post). I'm not likely to ever be a hardcore super fan (I wasn't with SW either), but I'm definitely invested in Picard and Section 31 -- we've watched the trailer and speculated what might happen. We're having an incredible bonding experience and I'm very grateful for that. Also as a Bond fan it's really nice seeing Michelle Yeoh get so much deserved attention.

tl;dr: I'm sorry, Star Trek fans, for being so narrow minded and judging your franchise before giving it a chance. Sorry for assuming something so 'cheesy' had nothing of value to offer, or that a show about avoiding conflict could be as gripping as the exact opposite.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

That said, my question:

irl person would nominate starship captain,"Keeping in mind this does not mean solely a military mind but extends to many areas of diplomacy, etc, but I hope I'm preaching to the choir here. 

I found an blog [post](https://26thfleet.enjin.com/mobile/forum/viewthread/m/9239612/id/25104089-so-you-want-to-be-starship-captain-guide-command) which outlines the qualifications in some detail, but I don't feel is the end all be all for this thought exercise, but serves as a good guide. 


&gt;Across the United States armed forces, NASA, and countless international civil services including police and fire authorities*, those who are in positions of command over a unit of personnel rely on something simply called the Five Paragraph Order to organize and explain critical information.

*Including the one which the author of this essay works for in Australia

The five paragraphs – each with a critical component of relevant information – are easily remembered by the acronym “SMEAC”: Situation, Mission, Execution, Administration/Logistics, Command/Communications.



Mission: Based upon the Situation, the commanding officer will then determine their mission objectives based on the simple questions of who, what, when, where and why? Simply, the mission determines the objective that is to be achieved, and nothing more.

Execution: Once the officer knows what the mission objective is, they may formulate a plan of how to do it – this is the execution phase of their briefing, and is – after the initial situation report – the most important phase of their orders.

In establishing a plan of execution, the officer should:

· Establish their intent clearly so that their staff understands what needs to be done,
· Identify the odds of success or failure, and what factors dictate advantage or disadvantage,
· Identify what tools and assets they have at their disposal to best exploit weaknesses,
· Understand what the outcome should be and the factors that need to be considered after the fact,
· Form a plan based on the above information to achieve the desired outcome,
· Identify factors outside their control that can be used to support their mission,
· Delegate tasks to crew and subordinate officers,
· Establish how those with delegated tasks should coordinate their actions.

Administration/Logistics: Having established and committed to a plan of action, the officer must take steps to ensure those whose task it is to indirectly support the mission (such as medical, engineering, armouries and shipboard magazines/weapons storage, damage control, fighter pilots providing air support, etc) understand what is required. Again – simply put – once your force of soldiers are carrying out their mission, how do you plan to supply them with food, ammunition, and medical support for wounded? All of these thought processes are just as critical to areas of starship operations as they are ground forces.

Command and Communications: The final part of the briefing is to establish the operational chain of command, and how a force is to communicate once they are engaged in their operations. This task can be simple, or it can be very complex depending on the size of the mission in question. In practice, at a basic level, junior starship captains will only need to worry about their own ships. It falls to Captains and Admirals to worry about the fleet itself.",startrek,1568295862,CaptainKyloStark,69,18,True,2019-09-12

regarding chakotay amp voyager skewed portrayal native american culture,"It's well documented that Voyager's production crew screwed up massively by hiring a fraudulent consultant on Native American culture, then proceeded to let this inaccurate and stereotypical idea influence a lackluster handling of Chakotay himself and references to his culture and backstory. Very much a grievous mistake on their part (one of many on Voyager, I suppose, but that's neither here or there).

What gets me curious is whether or not this could be justified by the future setting. As Voyager's own ""11:59"" displayed, knowledge of family/cultural history can be massively skewed and misled through stories over time even with Starfleet's high-tech historical recordkeeping. With this in mind, what's not to say it's fairly reasonable that the religion and culture of Native Americans and other groups around the earth did blend, mutate and alter philosophies together to become the kind of culture that Chakotay claimed to come from on screen? 300 years and all the wars Earth went through before First Contact likely did a number to any spiritual cultures persisting through strife and advancement as the Federation arose.

With that in mind, the way Chakotay's people were portrayed does seem reasonable, but it does beg the question of whether that makes it okay or not. Misrepresentation of native culture isn't new, but using it with the excuse of ""well it's the future, it'll be different then"" is a bit of a simplistic excuse to use. If Chakotay had his own version of the ""11:59"" plot ideal to represent how cultures change over time, maybe then it could be more presentable?

I dunno, what do other people think? Could you write away Chakotay's native culture being so weird and fictionally divergent, or should it have help accurately to cultures we have today despite the 300-year difference?",startrek,1568304894,Drewsko199,22,2,True,2019-09-12

cmv ds tried way hard stick tng writing suffered,"Admittedly, I haven't seen all of DS9, but the scenes I tend to see touted as ""the best"" seem to be leaning heavily on, ""Hey, kid, this ain't your daddy's Star Trek,"" and are either poorly written or portray the main cast as unlikable as a result. Some examples in increasing magnitude include:

""We'll have Sisko yell in Picard's face!"" Yes, because if there's one thing the military loves (and in DS9 Star Fleet is portrayed as more of a military than a diplomatic organization) it's when people get overly emotional and scream at their superior officer.

""Then later we'll have Sisko punch Q in the face!"" This one makes sense for a lot of reasons, the first being that Q, of course is a humanoid, physical being that can be punched in the face. The second being that if there is one thing Q respects, it's your capacity to punch people in the face, so of course Q would respect him and leave him alone after that.

""And finally, we'll have Sisko nuke an entire planet! Oh, so badass! Picard would never do that!"" No, Picard would never do that for a number of reasons including the fact is is a diplomat, he actually cares about the sanctity of sentient life, and there's the tiny little matter of it being a war crime that kind of just gets swept under the rug in DS9. And I understand that DS9's characters are meant to be ""flawed,"" but there is a line between flawed hero and outright villain, and that line was crossed light years ago when you view using chemical weapons on a civilian population as justifiable means to capture one man.",startrek,1568311957,bwick702,37,0,True,2019-09-12

Well, I just found out that Seth MacFarlane (as we know, is a huge Trek fan), wanted to get the music from Best of both Worlds for his 100th episode of Family Guy (Stewie kills Lois). But couldn't get the rights from paramount. So what did the madman do? Have composer, Ron Jones, create something similar for the episode.

I can't link to the episode in question for obvious copyright reasons and advice you to find the episode yourself to hear the music in the final act of the first episode. To me, it's uncanny and a fantastic piece of music that is very reminiscent of season 3's finale but not really the exact same.

It's pretty common for the best directed movies to be the best movies overall, but that's not always the case. Likewise, a movie can have excellent direction and just suffer in other areas like writing. Part of what struck me was in rewatching TMP and TWOK back to back -- the two movies are directed very differently, and I prefer Robert Wise's work, but ultimately I view TWOK as the better movie overall. I started to wonder how TWOK would look differently if the script remained mostly the same but Wise returning to the big chair.

I got to the end of the scene before I realised that without even *trying*, Voyager shows women to be just as yadda yadda as men.  I'll forgo the patting on the back we usually do as trek fans about how culturally advanced Trek has been throughout its many incarnations, but unlike Kirk and Uhura, or the notion of Janeway being the First Female Captain etc - here you have three women, all who are there because that's what they'd be doing if this was real (i.e. they're not forced together in a Scene Of Women, you've just got the Captain, the Chief Engineer and the Techy.  All of it is professional.  There is drama, there is tension, there is conflict, there is resolution and there is comedy.  All over subjects such as medical things, rules, science / tech - and the interpersonal relationships between the three (mommy with her two normally-squabbling daughters) - and it's just perfect.

There's no big statement about how women are just as capable.  There's no speech about equality.  

It's not mentioned.

finished rewatching ds,"The last 10 episodes of S7, crowned with What You Leave Behind, is certainly a tour de force. EASILY the best season finale in all Trek. I have so many things to say it'd take a book.

So just this - I don't know if it's the best Trek. I think my heart still belongs to TNG, mainly because of the inimitable naive optimism and also Picard. There just isn't a character as engaging and acted as brilliantly anywhere else.

But I would say that DS9  does most other things better. The average acting level is higher than any other Trek show (the standouts for me are Auberjonois, Visitor, Meaney, Alaimo), the tricks are astounding for the time, the galactic war plot is awesome and some of the deep character episodes like Duet, Far Beyond the Stars (such a delight to see those actors in more ""natural"" roles) or In the Pale Moonlight are forever in the same hall of fame as Inner Light or Measure of a Man.

I think it's safe to say Behr at al. matched the original Roddenberry vision with their own. They created a different Trek but equally great. And you know what's best about it?

You have your replicator. A peaceful life. Why care if the dominion takes over? Even if the Klingons take over, they don’t kill civilians. 

I’ve always imagined that most races don’t care. “Oh we are now in Federation space. Oh ok. We are now part of the Romulan empire. Whatever.”

Apart from the Borg, things wouldn’t change so much no matter who was in charge. 


That’s why most of Starfleet is human. 

I think only a few races have the motivation to care about politics and their motivations differ. 

Humans care because they are self righteous nerds. 

Romulans care because they are paranoid. 

Klingons care because they want to fight. 

Cardasians care because they want to show off their superiority. 

The Ferengi care because they are greedy. It is the useless of the Ferengi greed that makes them cool. Yeah sure they could just kick back and enjoy life but they don’t. They impose outdated norms (greed) to drive themselves to action. In a universe where most races are apathetic, the Ferengi are refreshingly active.",startrek,1568428307,sithlordbinksq,13,0,True,2019-09-13

This suggests he can only see with his ""eyes"" but we've seen Odo transform into a multitude of objects that do not have eyes or ears....yet he still seems to be aware of what is going on around him.

The episode where Quark is looking around for him and he ends up ""being the table"" comes to mind first.",startrek,1568440200,ilovebeermoney,15,23,True,2019-09-14
please help dad year memorial,"September 26 will be the 10th anniversary of my father’s death. 

He ADORED Star Trek and I’m a fan myself. 

However, I’d like to do something meaningful for this anniversary that he would think was impressive could he actually see it himself. 

Any creative ideas are welcome. It doesn’t have to be at the grave site. It can be on the water or what have you. 

He pretty much liked everything but Enterprise and he passed away before Discovery. 

Any ideas, please. This anniversary is hurting it’s as much as the first, for some reason. 

Thank you. LLAP :)",startrek,1568441970,absolutspacegirl,15,31,True,2019-09-14

wormhole aliens evil species star trek,"We see numerous examples of them forcing people to work against their will to advance the morals the wormhole aliens hold. 

The example that most comes to mind though is the Ferengi. The wormhole aliens  put into play every plot point we see in DS9 which would include the changes that are forced onto the Ferengi people. 

The Ferengi had a working culture that they enjoyed yet through the interference of the wormhole aliens changed everything about their culture until it was unrecognizable to what it had been before. This seems very similiar to how the Borg force you to work against your will .

We also see the Wormhole Aliens kill thousands of sentient beings for not having the same agenda they do.

I am hard pressed to find any other species besides the Borg that force their will on  other species in this manner.",startrek,1568451480,themightykazoo,0,0,True,2019-09-14

We see many examples of species being mistreated by the Federation while not being allowed any sort of voice in what happens in the Federation. There are many episodes regarding species who were not considered good enough to have a spot on the council. Most species in the Federation have rules dictated to them rather than allowing them to voice their concerns. 

My main issue is The Federation is extremely racist/specist. We have see some form of racism from crew in every Startrek TV show.  Kirk and other members of Starfleet command call the Klingons ""animals"" and demands the  complete death of their species. They want this species to go extinct. Not just those that have raised arms up against the Federation but all of them. Demanding the extinction of a species that you only view as animals is on par with what the Nazis wanted with the Jews.

We see type of hatred later reflected in the hatred for Cardassians that many members of the Federation hold after that war. O'brian often uses racial slurs and other attacks to refer to them.

Than we see how Sisko hates the Ferengi and even more so the Vorta.  He does things to members of these species just out spite. 

The Federation is also willing to commit genocide against groups of people based solely on their opposition to Federation Ideals.",startrek,1568452558,themightykazoo,5,0,True,2019-09-14

He was up to his usual tricks and turning into things people most fear etc but he couldn't work out how to scare Data.
